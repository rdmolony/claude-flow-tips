## Communication Tips

### Specify Requirements Before Starting
The better your initial specification (300-400 words), the better Claude Flow's results. Ask Claude to identify 10 unclear areas, answer them, then step away.

**Why this matters:** Clear specifications prevent iteration cycles and improve agent coordination.

**Confidence:** High

## Development Workflow

### Use Batchtool for Parallel Agent Operations
Batchtool is the key technology that enables Claude Code to spawn multiple agents as separate OS processes for parallel task execution.

**Why this matters:** Parallel execution dramatically improves development speed and coordination efficiency.

**Confidence:** High

## Agent Management

### Communicate via Slack or GitHub for Bi-directional Sync
Establish communication channels between agent swarms and external systems for real-time coordination.

**Why this matters:** Enables continuous integration and human oversight of agent activities.

**Confidence:** Medium
