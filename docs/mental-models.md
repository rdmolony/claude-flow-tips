## Agent Coordination Models

### Swarm Intelligence Framework
Think of Claude Flow agents as a swarm intelligence system where individual agents coordinate to solve complex problems collectively.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Emergence:** Complex behaviors arise from simple agent interactions
- **Decentralization:** No single point of control or failure
- **Self-organization:** Agents adapt their roles based on task requirements

**Why this matters:** Understanding swarm principles helps design better agent coordination strategies.

### Parallel Processing Mental Model
Claude Flow's batchtool enables true parallel processing by spawning agents as separate OS processes.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Process Isolation:** Each agent runs independently
- **Concurrent Execution:** Multiple tasks execute simultaneously
- **Orchestrated Coordination:** Central orchestration manages parallel workflows

**Why this matters:** Parallel processing fundamentally changes how you approach task decomposition.

**Confidence:** High

## System Architecture Concepts

### Security Boundary Model
Claude Flow operates within security boundaries that must be carefully managed.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Safe environments limit potential damage
- **Permission Models:** Different permission levels control agent capabilities
- **Trust Boundaries:** Clear separation between trusted and untrusted environments

**Why this matters:** Proper security modeling prevents system compromise and data loss.

**Confidence:** High

## Workflow Patterns

### Specification-First Development Model
Effective Claude Flow usage starts with clear, detailed specifications before execution.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Upfront Clarity:** Invest time in clear specification (300-400 words)
- **Iterative Refinement:** Ask for clarification on unclear points
- **Step-Away Pattern:** Define requirements then let agents execute

**Why this matters:** Quality specifications lead to better agent performance and fewer iterations.

**Confidence:** High

> "The team suggests specifying what you want beforehand in 300-400 words, and to ask Claude to clarify 10 things that are unclear or need to be improved, answer, then walk away."

## Performance Models

### Coordination Overhead Model
Understand the trade-offs between coordination benefits and overhead costs.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Communication Costs:** More agents mean more coordination overhead
- **Synchronization Points:** Coordination requires synchronization between agents
- **Optimal Agent Count:** Balance between parallelism and coordination complexity

**Why this matters:** Helps optimize agent count and coordination strategies for specific tasks.

**Confidence:** Medium
