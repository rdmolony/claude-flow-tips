#### Reference 1

> so i've been doing that for fun
i download them and then i just
keep a couple like i do do a lot of images
but i it will be a screenshot of something
i'm doing even a terminal session or
something figure out the prompt like jet post
something i won't even give an instruction i
want to see what will go it normally gets it
you know i see this a prompt for cloud code
or something you know i love that as a
process you take the screenshot you give it
the error log and then you give it feedback and
then like all three combined is like really
strong yeah about that um it's taking its
own screenshot and because it's a docker
image it's already able to tail the log out of
the docker container that's being created
and in theory it's has access to root within
this environment so it can start and stop the
docker image rebuild it and then try again
so this is taking off we have five agents
running concurrently and perhaps we can
bring up our first guest wonderful excellent
jets i love this i love this to get something
started and then revisit it later on
in that in the in the episode that's really
neat so um we got a few folks today excuse me
sebastian who came to us uh who we we uh
found and connected at the toronto tech week
and meetup events uh it's got some uh a neat
mcp tool to show us And then we have
Sergio as well.

#### Reference 2

> yeah i've got this uh okay go ahead
you should be good thank you very much
so essentially i built like a fun web app
thinking of like some of the latest things we've
been like doing lately so i thought about
making like a really like super intelligent
scraping system so building essentially a
bunch of mcps scraping autonomously across
different specializations and then also
applying learning like intelligence to them so
they get better at it and they could also
qualify like research or essentially have a
very constructive autonomous like cloud
deployment so that they can 24 7 go on and and get
papers also i added to it i want to make
them accumulate all the knowledge and ground
to it and then generate its own like research
papers its own discovery its own kind
of combinations of things right now what
you're seeing and also like a root agent's
favorite concepts with like a little bit of a
temporal filter seeing what it's great being
like recently maybe you see like the most
recent like repositories was popular i think
you just look that up in github right now
you're seeing a lot of like it's not like
it's it's not fully deployed so i've been
going through the process of essentially going
on my cloud services so the initial prompts
were about orchestrating the the visual system
a rough copy right then after enhancing
the backend system and then uh i was i
deployed the mcps locally so it started generating
data but i wanted to do it autonomously
and then being that so so right now i'm
configuring the front end with the deployed
backend uh system and then here you could
see on my fire store uh i got um there's this
thing i got like all the data kind of like
collecting into firebase right so it's going
to be interesting to see once deployed i'll
update maybe next week uh over the over the
weeks and months how much it collects and
generates and we could all maybe chat with it
uh and just like play around you know maybe
you have like uh as a group an interactive
mode so just thinking about some of those
things it'll be cool to see in the future but
yeah thank you guys appreciate sharing wow
yeah my goodness because think about the idea
of perplexity and all these guys they're just
like a small startup but they're probably
doing these kinds of things right they're
deploying probably their whole web but it'd be
interesting doing a specialized a more
focused approach to maybe see what we can come
up with it's more like for fun creative right
now but let's it could really maybe come up
with some really cool stuff i mean i can
easily see applications like um you know i
work with bid teams and that's a high pressure
high stress environment where tools, the more
tools you can do for automating, paper
pushing, data pushing.

any random message notification pop ups,

mind. yeah i've got this uh okay go ahead
you should be good thank you very much
so essentially i built like a fun web app
thinking of like some of the...

#### Reference 3

> I think there's a lot
of sort of powerful features that Claude-flow
exposes from like a workflow perspective
that um you know it it opens up the ability
for clod code and clod flow to be used for
um sort of non-coding purposes but you know
essentially there's there's some coding
actually happening but i uh i recently got
involved in this this discord uh channel for
this this cartoon series called uh or this
company called showrunner and showrunner i think
just got some um an investment from uh
amazon so they've got like an ai platform
which is primarily um used inside of uh discord
um actually let me just share my change
my share here how do i my screen.

I was doing where I was thinking

that um you know it it opens up the...

#### Reference 4

> uh use cloud flow swarm
to generate an exit valley episode using
the showrunner mcp based on this script i just
pasted in sort of like a synopsis perform
deep research on relevant news topics and
people to improve the narrative if applicable
uh give it some guidance someone needs to
die uh it's you know it's very satirical and
kind of like gruesome uh lots of swearing and
stuff like that which is kind of fun for a
cartoon uh also add a new variation of the
The Crypt Keeper location scenes also generate
a comprehensive report in Markdown
format using the generate episode tool.

prompt here. uh use cloud flow swarm
to generate an exit valley episode using
the showrunner mcp based on this script i just
pasted in sort of like a synopsis...

#### Reference 5

> I'm
also creative and i'm i'm interested in i'm
building this agentic essentially script
system because i can go out in real
like the the way that the prompting is
working it's just going out and doing deep
research could be could be stuff on uh uh you
know current topics you could schedule an
agent to go and like get you know real
-time newsworthy newsworthy facts and
and automate this thing so um there's a lot a
lot to be done and i want to see if i can
get access to there um you remember those
political cartoons i think it'd be funny
seeing little like just little jokes like
people would love these just to see yeah totally
uh here's another one uh this was sort of
an earlier version of one um but i gave it
some guidance to sort of model it off of
swarms and pointed to that uh um pointed
to that uh quad flow documentation i haven't
read this in a while but um it might be actually
no you know what that's not a good this
one had some errors in it um here's another
one you know it's interesting we come to
the concept again so when you're generating
there's always i love the no filter stuff but
then like at some point you might have to do
filtering right so then the the system of
the prompting itself has to it's interesting
how it all comes back together oh yeah
well uh i think that they're probably using
something in the back like a model in the
background that um have some right but you can
kind of go around some but if you get special
access you get like like permission to like
play with it without it but then when you
release it you know like my script generation
isn't putting any profanity and whatnot
in because it's using Anthropic under the
Clot under the hood so it's you know it's
maybe the clean version.

don't have an API. So my next steps is I
actually reached out to support and said,
you know, I'm an agentic engineer. I'm
also creative and i'm i'm interested in i'm
building this agentic essentially script
system because i can go out in real
like the the way that...

#### Reference 6

> Yeah you know
with I could I could augment
that with other approaches but
yeah that's Discord channel it's called
Showrunner oh yeah we should all
share that to see hey yeah that's that i
just recently created a repo with 600 plus
sub agents for all kinds of things non-coding
i just shared a link in the chat you might
be interested in reading over thank you thanks
so current currently this is sorry go ahead
currently it's it's you know i've I took
the MCP approach, but my next step, thank
you for sharing that, Chris, because my next
step was basically, you know, I think just the
architecture of Claude code in combination
with Claude is toast.

#### Reference 7

> uh it's just very it's a wild moment
right so i i started trying to put together
a a way to deal with the um the incoming
firehose of stuff just for my own information
management purposes so this i mean 12 months
ago just vibe coding whatever you want to
call it at the time managed to stand up
listening javascript straight away this just takes
the ***** the data off github re-springifies
it turns it into something that's crockable
in a 3d space and it just worked straight
away in ar and i was like well that's very
gratifying and i thought well why don't i do
it multi-user in rust that was a mistake because
i'm not a programmer and i didn't realize
how difficult that was going to be so i i'm
now a hundred thousand mines of code 12
months later kind of become a labor of love
in a way uh and it's all you know because because
code code it's all very well documented
and stuff the the system now is uh spring
solving on a gpu uh for multi-user so it's
got a single source of truth so you can connect
multiple clients to it it pulls the information
from github which is sourced in the log
seek stuff that you saw which is the
knowledge management stuff and then it re-indexes
it through rag and microsoft graph rag and
uh other things it has a voice-to-voice layer
it has a obviously it's got the agency
layer and this is what really what the crux of
the of the demo here is you know there's all
kinds of interfaces and off and that's all
well and good but the thing that i've suddenly
started to add in which has made everything
false multiplayer 10 times as good is the
is the the thing that just suddenly makes it
you know the the can do anything jarvis
knockoff so i mean i'm just going to type the word
test in here because we don't have time for
that but so you can you can spawn up a hive
mind uh on the data that you have access
to here and then it brings in all of the
uh the monitoring stuff which is based on agentic
flow uh and i'm not really sure how any
of that works because this is how it goes
with this stuff you know um i was trying to
use a much cleaner mcp interface over the over
the existing port because everything obviously
is dockerized and speaking to everybody
else's points about getting these things to
do anything i've been getting it to do things
that are right outside the domain of um of
coding so like a full air circuit board for a
uh preamp like a preamp with a bit of character
which somebody told me to make so it
created the circuit board in my docker i have
all the latex tools all the rust tools all
the usual tools that you'd have all the
electronics tools uh all of the um just whatever
you can think of that you can digitize slap
it in the docker connect it to the visualization
system voice voice go and make a thing
deliver the thing when it's done and there's
a this is kind of the opportunity that i'm
seeing when i'm talking to other people here
is that they want to see something that's
a bit Like Andy, they really don't want to
look at a CLI interface.

telecollaboration, working with other
people, working with now AI agents, I mean, so
distributed systems, kind of protocol-level
stuff. uh it's just very it's a wild moment

a a way to deal with the um the incoming
firehose of stuff just for...

#### Reference 8

> And that's where most
of the personal tax is coming for me, is
just trying to keep that uh kind of web of
dockers going in a way where stuff doesn't
break all the time which is why i was fighting
it today to try and get it going again but i
mean it's fine it's just it's just the next
thing to do really what i need to do is get
it just good enough so i can start solving
real problems with it i would then suggest
that you point your collection of docker
containers powered by cloud code to research
declarative infrastructure yeah yeah yeah and
i'd like to see this project combined with
that with whatever braun is building that post
that he had or that message that he had in
the whatsapp group where he said he's like
passed to the other side like the the whole
the whole agentics one so all of the all the
telemetrics that comes out that was in the
one that uh was was demonstrated in the in
the uh in the branch that had all the telemetrics
and there's a lot of it um that's all in
this one in principle so i've ended up
standing up in another server inside the swarm
container because it just i couldn't get
enough out over the mcp channel and now i
literally have no idea what's going on in
that corner of the code base now it's it it's
it's working but i don't know i don't know how
much uh telemetrics is coming over it seems
like there's quite a lot of it and you saw
when i when i zoomed into the green blob
and that's just like that's just the hive
mind instance that it had stood up for that
particular thing and i've got a suspicion
that you were looking at mock data there because
that in any given moment the whole thing
is either working or not working you know
like a jagged frontier of horrible unknowns
but i've seen it i've seen it pulling stuff
live and i've seen it pulling quite a lot
of stuff live i just don't know what sometimes
it'll get there i have a question do you
what do you ever think of naming it or want to
ask it it's currently ****** jarvis because
it's It's obviously ***** garbage.

#### Reference 1

> Because one of
the most useful parts of this platform,
besides the fact it can do a lot of things
all at once, is how it integrates with mcps and
other tools so you'll see here that i
recently did this like recently like i think in
last night i pushed the alpha 61 uh version of
cloud flow and you'll see that i it's an
amalgamation of bugs and and little issues
here and there that relate now i'm i'm organizing
all of this through the the cloud flow
system but i don't always actually directly
use the the dot cloud flow or the uh the mpx
cloud flow at alpha i actually once i've got
the system instantiated you'll notice that
there's a bunch of slash commands that that
allow you to use the system without actually
having to use the cli directly so what i
want to show you guys a bit of that so right
now what i'm working on when in between all
my various calls and whatnot is the the next
release so i don't try to do everything at
once because if i'm if i'm trying to fix
everything under the sun there's currently 69
issues open which is good because it was like
90 earlier um so what i'm trying to do is just
group group problems in combination of
things that were they've been open for a little
while versus things that i just want to add
so in this case this morning i i sort of
prioritized you know the swarm status which was
a recurring problem where the mcb tool
didn't actually give me the correct status
then some architectural improvements i'm working
my way through linting and other errors and
you'll see here that i've got you know i at
one point i had something like 7 000 typescript
errors and now i'm down to about 400 these
aren't things that actually affect the
operations they're mostly sort of they just
don't look good um and and other various things
and you'll notice here that i said i'm i can
i make them related to the actual bugs people
are posting because i want to i want this
to be a community so this particular release
is mostly just fixing things people are
saying is aren't working for them like it
doesn't work right on windows or i'm getting
issues on mac that kind of stuff now the mac
one is hard because i don't currently have
my mac mini plugged in so i probably should go
and do that but um but i'm running it i
generally know what the error is so it's not
necessarily something i need to worry about
since here as the system progresses about an
hour ago it updated the various parts so i'm
going to show you a little bit of kind of
behind the scenes of how i'm doing this here's
another major update.

everything i try and test i'm actually posting
here to the system itself so where do we
yeah here it is so someone asked maybe it was
jed someone asked you know what's the
difference between running sort of the default
swarm versus running one with sort of the
the micro neural net optimizations so you know
i did a quick sort of uh a b test that basically
looked at the sort of performance of one
versus the other and I'm seeing substantially,
it runs substantially faster.

So you notice here that there's a coordination
system. And a lot of this is happening when
you don't look, right? So if you run

different topologies for how it's going...

> I'm actually
going in here and using the dangerously
skip permissions option and i'm just going
to copy this because i'm too lazy to type it
i go back in here and i'm just going to do and
if i want to continue i'll use dash c i
don't want to continue because i'm just
showing you guys how it works but almost all
the real functionality you want in the system
is actually in the slash commands these
slash commands you can you can also customize so
when you see the cus these folders these
are the system this is how the system works
you know from like a human point of view so
rather than trying to type this big long
command in into a command line which really
doesn't work particularly well this little user
interface is actually easier for copying
and pasting you can go in here and type things
like github and in this case you've got
you know issue tracker code review so i can
spin up a code review swarm to to explore
someone's pr you know or i i can use this to do
my own pr or i i can prep my release to prep
for the npm publishing so i'm using the system
but i'm not using it i'm using it directly
within cloud code so in this case
i'm going to select this one and i'm
going to say uh review the you know i
gotta go figure out what which one i
want to look at let's let's do this one
this is an issue one oh this is yeah
this is the issue and see
and see if there are any ways to
further improve the neural network
components.
