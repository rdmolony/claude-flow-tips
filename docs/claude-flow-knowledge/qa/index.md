#### Reference 1

> So now with the rise of
Claude Max, where you can get the sort of
unlimited use, it's not unlimited, but for
all intents and purposes it is unlimited i
i do max out when i start going into like
crazy land of you know spawning hundreds of
agents at a time but to be honest most of the
swarms you're going to do aren't going
to be in the hundreds anyway they're going to
be probably somewhere between five and maybe
20 agents that work concurrently we've
added a whole variety of different new features
we i'll show you here in a moment things
like the hive mind this is a system that allows
this the the agents to use a queen
orchestrator which is also pretty crazy the other
day the orchestrator named herself seraphina
which was uh i guess a biblical god uh
like the top angel in heaven i didn't even
know that was a thing and apparently that's
funny because i have a very good friend
called seraphina by the way it's a real name
really it's yeah and so she's the a six-wing
god or six wing wing angel he is an angel
by the way okay there you go right it's it's
i i i'm not up to speed on my uh on my
biblical history so but there you go but if of
all the names to give itself herself it was
an interesting choice um and i'll dig in that
a little bit we get the neural networks
so the system can now you know attempt to fine
-tune itself uh we've got a variety of MCP
tools, right, I'd say 87 at this point.

other. And the biggest issue we've had with these
types of environments is they were
prohibitively expensive. So now with the rise of
Claude Max, where you can get the sort of
unlimited use, it's not unlimited, but for
all intents and purposes it is...

#### Reference 2

> So
we're going to go back here I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna copy and paste the first code so
this is gonna install the anthropic cloud
code and again a couple assumptions here you're
paying for a pro account at the very minimum
if you use a swarm the pro account will
essentially last you about 20 minutes and
then you'll be you'll be quoted for several hours
if you're using the hundred dollar you
can probably get away with the five agent swarm
for several hours if you're using the two
hundred dollar you can go all day now if you're
like me and you're running concurrent
swarms you know then you're gonna max it out
after a while but I I I'm comfortably doing
a few hundred thousand lines of code an hour
using the two hundred dollar plan it's it's
crazy all right so while while I was blabbing
here this was this was setting up so
now I've got a really generic I'm gonna create
a new branch let's call it July 10th and I'll
create that then what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to copy this in.

> **Context:** ... When you
use it through VS code directly, this problem
doesn't happen, but I'm going to show you
how to get around that problem anyway. So
we're going to go back here I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna copy and paste the first code so
this is gonna install the anthropic cloud
code and again...

#### Reference 3

> So
what I'm seeing a lot of folks do is they, once
this is instantiated, they're just going
into cloud code and they're instantiating
this inside an existing repo and then they're
saying go customize the command customize
the cloud md file to meet the specifics of
this particular repo so what i'm giving you
is a kind of generic template to create
these either hive style or or more traditional
if you will swarms but you you can
instantiate any way you like so in this case
you i i did it that way now this is running
here so now it's suggesting here that
i've got uh and i wasn't fast enough so it's
decreasing it's so it's auto tuning itself
so in this case it's decided to reduce the
concurrency of agents to nine so i'm going to
go ahead and just grab this and we're going
to create yet another instance and then then
we're going to get the swarm to go do
something so this again this is the hive this
is the hive mind so create research oh what
are we gonna research any ideas
what what you guys want to create
research and create the most amazing
breakthrough of all time and build it.

> **Context:** ... are basically the commands
you see here for like GitHub. So if I
was to choose GitHub, I can get all those
commands and you can customize these. So
what I'm seeing a lot of folks do is they, once
this is instantiated, they're just going
into cloud code and they're instantiating
this inside an...

#### Reference 4

> That's why I just wasn't
thinking, but if I installed it globally,
that wouldn't have an issue all right so
i'm going to go ahead and instantiate that
we can see here that now it's launching the
swarm starting with initial worker count
four it's using the dangerously skip
permissions it's using the auto spawn to launch
instances automatically it's verbose so
it can see it it's using the shared mcp
swarm memory usage which will store the
information to the actual shared memory, which
we can take a look at here as well while
it's sort of starting up.

> **Context:** ... I didn't install globally, I've got
to add the at alpha. Now I'm, I'm, I'm
usually running in my dev environment where
I started globally. That's why I just wasn't
thinking, but if I installed it globally,
that wouldn't have an issue all right so
i'm going to go ahead and instantiate...

#### Reference 5

> I'm giving some other
information about the mcps that needs to interact
with to sort of understand learning and task
orchestration and worker management and
then i'm giving examples it's just a well a
sort of well-defined prompt now at the bottom
here you can see it instantiating it's
kind of flickering a little bit which is i
know it's because i'm on my smaller monitor
but basically i can't really show it because
it doesn't let me scroll too much but basically
it's it's instantiating the memories and we
can see that when i go to the hive system
here for a moment We'll see that
it follows well.

consensus algorithm majorities and different
settings. I'm telling it what the researchers
need to do. I'm giving some other
information about the mcps that needs to interact

orchestration and worker...

#### Reference 6

> Yeah, I've been looking
- called the limbo project it's not fully
compliant yet but that's where that's
where they're going and it's like really
fast we could probably rewrite that and that
might be a project and do right now when
it was with the swarm like and that's a
lot of what i'm doing is i'm rewriting
existing libraries so for example when you
look at my neural forecaster i took the
neural forecaster python library and i basically
pointed it at my swarm at that and
said build that for me bed and the same project
yeah so let's let's let's let's take a
look at limbo project all right so let's let's
do let's do a swarm let's do a swarm so
so let's go and i'm going to type this time
i'm going to do npx flood flow at alpha
but this time what i'm going to do is i'm going
to use a swarm rather than a hive mind
now the hive mind is currently running you
can see a building here in the alex with two
x's uh animator folder it's going to build
it it looks like it's probably going to build
it in i don't know sure what it's going
to build it in i never upload what language
to build it in and it's i can't quite tell
there's no files yet you know i guess we'll
let it keep doing its thing um well while
that does its thing i'm going to go and i'm
going to look at the swarm settings so i'm
just going to type swarm and i don't have
an objective so it's telling me i need an
objective so this to be honest most of the
work that i'm doing involves using the the
swarm capability or my github capabilities so
we go back we can see here we got other
options so it depends so when i get up in the
morning and i look at my repo and i see
these various uh issues like we'll we'll go
to my issues here and you'll notice that i
i respond to some of them you know, let's
see what we got here.

> **Confidence:** 80.0% `████████░░`
>
> **Context:** that. Now, while this does this thing- Just a
quick thing, Rufin, is that
there's a new rewrite of SQLite
and they're writing it in
Rust, by the way. Yeah, I've been looking
- called the limbo project it's not fully
compliant yet but that's where that's
where they're going and it's like...

#### Reference 7

> Yeah, I think that's
a good idea is to enhance the MCP
option because I think I asked Reuben
about this and he's using the
called Swarm, right?
>
> **Source:** `en-AI Hacker League July 10_ Mastering Autonomous Agents with CloudFlow and Swarm Technology.txt` - Line 262
> **Confidence:** 80.0% `████████░░`
>
> **Context:** ... that only select commands to GitHub's
API are exposed to the LLMS tools. That might
be a better way to fork it or improve
that specific feature. Yeah, I think that's
a good idea is to enhance the MCP
option because I think I asked Reuben
about this and he's using the
called Swarm, right? And...

#### Reference 8

> I've got
agent interactions, I've got code patterns,
error patterns, knowledge graph,
MCP tool usage.
>
> **Source:** `en-AI Hacker League July 10_ Mastering Autonomous Agents with CloudFlow and Swarm Technology.txt` - Line 377
> **Confidence:** 80.0% `████████░░`
>
> **Context:** ... quite a bit
more for it. So when you go here
and you see memory, this one's not
running currently, but you see here that
there's a lot more options. I've got
agent interactions, I've got code patterns,
error patterns, knowledge graph,
MCP tool usage. So I've taken it sort
of a bit further. Now...

#### Reference 9

> this was fixed in the
uh what was it in the uh swarm function that
i got spelled right create a issue with the
problem and solution use the cli yeah back
to jed's point the the cli i'm just using
cli for a lot of stuff you know the mcps are
useful but at least i know the clis work
so in this case i'm a uh an issue
we'll let and then oh man not
again so oh what oh he's back
you're back okay it's oh it crashed
again i think we're good guys
i apologize zoom's dead we
still hear you roof we can hear you
guys we can yeah we got your audio
can it be the streams i don't
think he hears us okay um yeah what
is this video we're probably gonna have
to benchmark his uh internet connection his
transcoding capacity yeah well he he might
have changed his camera pumping a ton more
data into his machine than whatever webcam
he was using it's not just that he's also
streaming to two other locations yeah he's got
a lot and youtube so like that's a lot of
transcoding maybe claude flow can build distributed
system for him.
>
> **Source:** `en-AI Hacker League July 10_ Mastering Autonomous Agents with CloudFlow and Swarm Technology.txt` - Line 487
> **Confidence:** 80.0% `████████░░`
>
> **Context:** ... an issue for
the following error using, you know,
error. When Claude code requires you
to re-enable the token, I'm getting
the following error. this was fixed in the
uh what was it in the uh swarm function that
i got spelled right create a issue with the
problem and solution use the cli yeah...

#### Reference 10

> I ran into my own
problem while using the latest version of pre
-alpha clod flow and basically it had to do
with resource exhaustion my computers are
running out of ram so i tried to i prompted clod
code to create an epic as an issue in the clod
the rovnet clod flow repo to detail a
solution that has the swarm that makes the swarm
aware of the remaining resources in the
specific environment and to decide whether it
should spin up another agent or to cue the
task for the existing batch of agents to
consume later.

> **Context:** ... a GitHub issue. Were we demonstrating
the ability for us to say when we notice
an issue about how to report back? Back to
your comment on the chat? I ran into my own
problem while using the latest version of pre
-alpha clod flow and basically it had to do
with resource exhaustion my computers...

#### Reference 11

> has questions i'll still be active
in the chat all right so let's
take a look at this um let's say so
right now there are certain issues so the most recent one
i submitted was uh about roof swan
is issue 13131 about roof swan machine
learning and then trying to get that integrated
with the root swan core because currently
the 27 neural models are not actually
integrated into the rust and then um so i'm
trying to get that working and then and
that is what working on and uh so via yeah
the i'm not using the uh release version of
root swan right now so i have to tell the
cloud code to use my local uh response
test mcp server please So you created a
branch and then you pulled your
branch down?

me how you did the report that I picked
on yesterday, man. You did an awesome
redo of it. I love the redo,
by the way. Oh, thank you.
has questions i'll still be active
in the chat all right so let's
take a look at this um let's say so
right now there are certain issues so the most...

#### Reference 12

> This is another
type of interesting pattern that the
Roof Swarm enabled because previously
when you do this kind of five-task
agent together, you can directly
via Cloud Code, yes, but this five-task agent,
they might conflict each other's work
quite a lot unless you get a very good
coordination going on.

> **Context:** ... get
crushed. It will have the capability to
double check, verify the task agent's
work, rather than to blindly just take their
words at face value. This is another
type of interesting pattern that the
Roof Swarm enabled because previously
when you do this kind of five-task
agent together, you...

#### Reference 13

> Sometimes two agents
might add the same file and then while
another agent is doing testing and then they
say oh all of work are done but then
when you get all the work together it is
not done maybe each individual task task
agent did their stuff so that is why you
need some kind of coordination system
therefore they do not conflict and then and
then this five six task agent are doing
one thing so that the orchestrators is
very clear and they just keep on going
okay one question here, or one idea.

the runner system yet.

can configure, we could configure a Reuben
Swarm to be a runner in the background, and
it could automatically do what Ocean is
doing. But I don't believe Swarm and
Flow are configured to use the workflow and
the runner system yet. Not yet, but I think
you are able to figure out...

#### Reference 15

> So some of my crazier
attempts is not just on so I want to mention
this the swarm pattern is not just for development
and then the github integration is not
just for software development so for
example here is a academic research project that
I did on a proving the point of a rust based
rust based framework that was doing for
capability um and then of course like something
we know about this vibe coding stuff is
you don't know what's going on in terms of
like okay it works but what is what does it
really make scientific sense or mathematically
proven so um one thing i did was i have the
swarm to go take a look at all the rust
code and then start to doing formal uh formal
verification and then derivation of each single
component to verify the claim i think this
is how the agentic is becoming a science
in that regard very cool um yeah so so
all of this stuff have incredible amount of deep
research behind uh it is coming up with its
own academic proposal evaluate the novelness
of those and then it is actually planning
to release those on my journal.

> **Context:** ... start to rearrange all of this issue
into a nice sequential plan. And then I'll
start just working on one by one in the exact
order I showed. So some of my crazier
attempts is not just on so I want to mention
this the swarm pattern is not just for development
and then the github...

#### Reference 16

> Like the reason I was doing this is
because I was playing with swarms of like one
to 200 plus deep seek agents running in
parallel.

> **Confidence:** 80.0% `████████░░`

loops built in to the way that the agents
basically are held accountable for the
output that they generate. The output is really
good. Like the reason I was doing this is
because I was playing with swarms of like one
to 200 plus deep seek agents running in
parallel. And by using...

#### Reference 17

> Go find out which DB that
we used, and please tell me, did the data
actually got saved are they being persisted
and what are in there so let's see if
there anything actually in the sqlite and you
know of course once you get things into
the sqlite you can use it however you can
so right now it found uh 41 agents in the
database 23 tasks uh okay it's gonna
show me some of those i i would in my opinion
i think uh this is very great feature
and then all of this data can be much better
utilized in terms of the uh how do
we do the neural network training for the
ontology optimization but of course
there's so much to experiment and explore
i i got the rust NCP just functional as
of kind of yesterday.

know what's going on unless you go see
this SQLite database. So right now I'm asking
it to save. Go find out which DB that
we used, and please tell me, did the data
actually got saved are they being persisted
and what are in there so let's see...

#### Reference 18

> yeah just so people
don't get confused uh ocean you're
you're working on the neural network component
with inside of of Claude swarm right so
they um just you're giving an example
of the work that you're doing just so
you recognize that so remember the roof
mentioned about his neurodivergent that
has like supposedly 27 machine learning
models that will optimize the
ontology the topology of the SWAN
framework as you go.

> **Context:** ... than
the current released version. I'm hoping
to finish this in a couple of days so
that the cloud flow can be even faster
and then more stable. yeah just so people
don't get confused uh ocean you're
you're working on the neural network component
with inside of of Claude swarm right so
they...

#### Reference 19

> It has all the data persisted and then they
can be later on reused and then validated, which
is the observability part because then you
can go see whether the optimization is
good or is it any use of any use but even
without the neural training this swarm pattern
itself is already include increasing the
um quality by a lot which is something i'm
most shocked at that topology by itself is
already very very capable all right um i think
that's uh it's a good cycle of how i how i
resolve issue to use swamp to develop swamp so
uh thanks everybody yeah great great stuff
ocean thank you it looks like we're we're at
the oh it's 11 o'clock here in san francisco
did you want to uh you want to close it
down or we're good keep going well if you're if
you're willing to host david happy to let it
keep going i do need to hop off me too man
i got a meeting as a reminder for everyone
else we do have the new york city agentics
meeting this afternoon this evening um i
believe the link is at agentics.

actually implementing right now to get
those functional and then with GPU
training support. Yeah. It seems to be fun.
It has all the data persisted and then they
can be later on reused and then validated, which
is the observability part because then you
can go see...

> But in
the little that I've investigated, I've
struggled a little to get uh it looks like
it defaults to like the github use uh
github i don't know what it is basically the
github's llm integration which makes it a
little tricky to use so let me let me
start by showing a little bit what
i'm working on here but and uh well and
welcome everyone and thanks for showing
up to another one of our live vibe coding
sessions all right so for those who are
new that basically all i do is show you
what i'm building and and in real time
so this is this is one of the things i'm
building right now this is a uh something
i it's it's super retro let's just so this
is basically a ui for the front end of claude
uh claude flow and i did it as retro as
i possibly could but basically what what
you're going to see here uh so what i'm building
this is a let's just go back out so
it's a see i don't know what you want to call
it a dashboard i guess so i'm using a
combination of components here i'm using web
sockets to connect to the the back end mcp oops
it looks like a jump it opened that up it's
super retro interface and uh in in this case
we we can see here that i've got a number
of tools here's a web socket i've got
my sync manager i'm looking here's the
information i'm getting so this allows me to sort
of get a feel for how it's going to run how
it's going to operate you'll see that all
the services started that looks good so now
i'm going to go back and we're going to
take a look so there's a few different elements
here you see that there's this sort
of initial dashboard components i don't know
why i've got two scroll bars that's a little
weird i got to fix that but anyway um now
we can go here we can see the swarm i can
uh i can add i can add my various swarm
elements so i can choose and we can spawn a
swarm i can i can choose different options like
an architect or or tester coordinator code
or whatever so then i can spawn it so i'm
going to spawn that we can zoom out i can

of researcher spawn that and i can move
those around oh maybe i don't move it around.

concurrent fashion. Supposedly, the open
code system does that. So I was going to try
to investigate that a little bit. But in
the little that I've investigated, I've
struggled a little to get uh it looks like
it defaults to like the github use uh

I wanted uh oh you know I need I need

a useful command by the way for clod code
that allows you to stream the output so
it skips their user interface so in this
case i'm going to say you know test a
con current uh agent swarm so the dash p
prints out the output the output format is
defined as the the json stream and then you need
verbose this is going to be the basis of
how i'm going to add a new feature here in a

So now I can, let's add a command here. Here,
let's add this one. oh no that's not what
I wanted uh oh you know I need I need
ability to clear this oh I guess I can
select all all right let's choose the right

#### Reference 3

> I probably
over, I'd probably that some sort of
overflow when i try to copy and paste all
that uh json we'll give that one more try
yeah you guys get to watch me debug i guess
if that's exciting i was waiting i have a
question that worked all right so so yeah
go ahead one thing note when you when
you're when you're recovering you can
always do dash c looks like i looks like
the restart worked so what was sorry what
was your question um i was curious
about the sequence of commands that
you explicitly um basically ask at the
beginning like during the flow so the previous
question was about explicitly calling
tdt as spark tdt um so i'm curious what's your
standard sequence of comments like spark
researcher and then spark studio code or then
spark tdd what's the sequence that you usually
recommend to follow so it it depends what
i'm doing and i'm not sure why this is
taking so long to start but i'll show you here
in a sec uh let's see here let's see another
plot and you see what's going on there that's
that's working oops wants to do that
roof i think this is a great question
um the way i i'm still getting used
to the whole swarm and i've been using
it for a few things but emmanuel like
the way i do is prd first then i say
to plot of plot flow basically um you know
this is the prd what do you recommend what
what what structure of agents number of agents
you recommend provide me full commands how
I proceed so then it tells me this is
how it is I initializes the swarm right and
then once it does that then I say okay go and
build it I think what I have not been doing
is as roof pointed out is because I would
prefer to do it through a TDD approach so I
should actually go into the cloud that
MD file and say follow maybe I need to put a
line in there to say follow tdd approach
spark but i guess your questions about
researcher and all of this stuff uh yeah i would
love you know prove your your inputs will be
welcome like how you know i think i guess
so you've got you've got different you've got
different modes right and those and those
modes can be invoked either through
programmatic means or often just you doing it so
in this case when you do slash and we do spark
you'll see that i've got different spark
modes i could ask you know i get integration
i got optimizer devops reviewer re you
know my here's my super base admin coders so
this is using sort of my my preferred approach
right so i've got so tdd obviously
would be td and i just did that up here so
in this case i told i basically said to
add the tdd components to my claw.

need to do? If it doesn't work, it's

overflow when i try to copy and paste all
that uh json we'll give that one more try
yeah you guys...

#### Reference 4

> md file
so now when i when i reinstantiate it's
going to have the tdd components included
automatically so here we go so now we
see here it's it's decided you know
i'll go here and i'll find it tdd so this
is how it's going to orchestrate the tdd
components and get it gives it more guidance
how to refactor how to do you know tdd
swarm roles for that so i've just given
i i've given it more guidance on how the
agents need to interact with when doing tdd based
components so i know there's a lot and i'm
what i'm trying to do here is not give
you everything because if i gave you everything
then it would just do nothing particularly
well so i'm i'm invoking certain things
at certain points when i need them and now
as part of the initial sort of guidance what
i might do is i might go with a research mode,
like Swarm Research or something, and I
might say, include a TDD-driven approach
using Spark or something, and it'll know to
include that as well.

got different matchers for write, edit,

and i could i could add it to like the

and then when it ends it does this last
session basically closes the session itself
and this is all being stored to the swarm
environment and and then i'm enabling my mcp
servers as well the roof flow and and roof
swarm components but there's a lot of opportunity
in in this particular file and i'm giving
you a generic sort of initial one but you
could you could fool around with that
let's see what else we got here what's i'm
still trying to get the the stream the output
i'm not sure what it's doing here i hate this
flickering thing i wish they would fix

#### Reference 6

> so you know essentially did a
review of of of the code base and then
said right based on um where we need
to go now let's plan forward and
and so that's where all these
issues started up um and then you
know it's again been very busy
it's it's we've got 45 closed
issues in here uh i'm showing you all
of the the admin um you should you see
it yeah that's it you do okay one sec sorry
um cool um so so i'm showing you all the all
the busy work um did it do anything well
what it did do is it created a new component
for roof fan called neural bridge i don't
know what the **** it is um i don't know
what it is but i love it it's a high
performance wasm neural network library with
samd acceleration and real-time monitoring um
anyway i've i've i've linked that to an issue
on the on the roof fan um github repo
um so you can take a look and see if that's
worth including and again not really sure
what it's doing it thought it needed to
optimize something in the process what's so can
you run it uh i don't i don't know if
you can just run it straight off the bat or
if it needs some other stuff again um not
not really too sure um have you talked to
claude code about it have you like have you
like at least like put it in the like try to
run it or like kind of ask like what what
exactly are you doing i i tried that i
couldn't understand it it's it's explain to
me like like i'm a like a 15 year old or
something is what i so this is reaching that
that edge here where ai we just are not
going to understand everything that's going
on this is like kind of like starting to
emerge so it's it's kind of the the ADHD brain
just moved me to other other tasks so
I got going with other things but anyway did
some pretty cool things in the meantime I
was trying to get the authentication working
so sorry I'm jumping around a little bit
the first feature I asked it to do was
well actually let's get the Claude max authentication
working because on the front page
hopefully this works on the front page the
idea is that you come in here and you
connect your Claude Max account and then if
everyone comes in and connects their Claude
Max accounts then we can kind of contribute
to the mega swarm and then we can all kind of
work on sorry if we're repeating because we
did this the other week but you know you'd
have your projects in here and I could
add my github repo you could add yours and we
could kind of vote on which tasks we wanted
to to get done together and as part of that
that mega swarm activity and some features
that it added since the other week was
that it added mcp tools so it's got the Claude
flow mcp server and some of those tools
are there and then you can come in and come
in and push buttons and do stuff it's probably
just a mock i don't really know what it's
doing but yeah it was it was a wild it was
a wild west cowboy attempt at trying to
do some kind of a merge and it was a fun learning
exercise um that's that's how i would
put it nice i like the ui i'm sure we could
get it get it working well i think i
think uh you've you've probably
leapfrogged with with your with
your fancy new CRT-inspired UI, Ruth?

only deliver based on those things and then
close them as you go. And it was it was very

i mean is open code also spawning up

wasn't sure if that was a command that you

this concept of batch mode right you can
batch batch the batch command allows you
this the hidden command that they took out of
the documentation that allows you to just spawn
off as many parallel instances of Claude
and that's native to to Claude that's we
didn't know what nobody coded that into Claude
that's just part of it but we discovered
that they removed that from their documentation
because they kind of, I guess they don't

in the last couple releases of cloud code
as well i don't know if anyone's seeing all
those yellow screens of errors that that
randomly pop up now but they're they're
it makes you know what all the errors i see
in cloud code make me feel better about the
errors and bugs that i put in in my various
tools if if a 170 billion dollar company apparently
is up with what they're worth can are
putting out bugs and makes me feel better
about me and my uh random office here in in
toronto doing the same thing um but yeah
it's been it's been a bit of a bit of a wild
ride they they came out that that letter or
that email earlier in the week and basically
without saying so called us out for using
parallel concurrent systems saying one user
in particular used uh you know hundreds of
thousands of dollars in credits i don't know
who that user is but it's probably someone
in our crew i would guess you know there
we you know 20 million lines of code just by
me in the last six weeks i think that there's
something crazy close to 20 million um is
any indication now remember i was bragging
earlier about the uh being able to 500 000
lines of code an hour cannot get anywhere
near that we're about 50 to 75 000 if for a
benchmark that that's where the quota currently
lies but um here we are we i'm not going
to spend too much time today doing the demos
because we have a ton of people and i'm not
even supposed to be here so um rob who do
we get lined up uh for our present you know
presenters today yeah we've got it we got a
full slate um so alex dubold one of the og
members he's been working on uh he's in the
optometry optometry and glasses and lens
manufacturing servicing that industry so he's
got a pretty neat setup he's going to show
us uh and then ocean on some optimizations
some swarm optimize orchestration optimizations
john petty uh from enabled and those guys
are crushing it on use cases which is
really fascinating uh and then i think dimple
we've also got um uh ravi is that right do
we have is dimple there no i don't think
so but no all right we've got ravi uh
shemioki from new zealand and uh uh and actually
in new zealand so on new zealand
hours so looking forward to seeing
him bright and early which which i think
is 4 a.

have to remember all the commands and all the

that do the the work that i need so if i
want to benchmark all i need to do is that
and it'll go and do my benchmarking for me or
if i want to you know make a neural network
or i want to send an email or research or
whatever I've got a I've got one client that's
actually using this to basically create
sort of personas for all their employees and
then when they hire someone new they they
can invoke these sorts of things and they're
using like a dashboard like a web-based
dashboard to do that so in this case it's asking
me some questions so when you create an
agent you can have it interactive like so it
guides you through you know questions and answers
so um just you know I'm just showing hey

to Iris's consumer facing side to say,
hey, I need to move my appointment great let
me find the appointment for you so that's
iris that's um i call this the the re the
cover sorry i call this the practice studio um
for the opticians to basically come in like
a co-pilot and help them run their business
of connecting all the data um making sure
that all the data is seamlessly going
automating all of the stuff that's usually done
manually because the customer experience is
usually pretty bad um but then actually just
giving them the workflows so that like the
agent can do it for them that's the demo
this is this is great you're you alex represent
what i like to call like kind of agentic
entrepreneur you you have been given the
power to build the things that you envision and
without having to go and hire an outsource
team well maybe you do i don't know but you
know but what i love about what i what i
see you and i've known i've known you for
what 20 years i've seen your sort of evolution
right and especially your evolution over the
last year and a half as you've sort of embraced
uh this technology i think you started
and you're like i'm not technical and all
of a sudden you're like i can i can literally
build anything i imagine and you're doing
it and you're doing amazing at it it's very
rewarding to see to see how you have evolved
over the last you know year or so yeah so i
didn't show you guys the last the last
part that's missing is because like ultimately
at the end of the day the last thing that i
want to do because you have to gain people
people's trust over time is i do actually want
to connect um to ml models around helping
with diagnosis so this exists in the background
it's this is not for public consumption
yet but the intent is that if there are
models out there that have been tested and
we have enough retail locations using the
platform then we can help on front end but we
can also help with the diagnosis with those
models in the future so this is all new i've
got a couple other projects um if people are
interested in learning more or want to help
me build some of these models happy to happy
chat hey alex yeah one thing about
this 200 uh question questionnaires they all
come from uh existing regulations like so if
you look for nist or sock or iso like you can
actually extract the questions and make yourself
like how to compliant and there is software
like doing that that costs like tens
of thousands of dollars yeah the the interesting
thing here though is that like one of
the brands that we're working with in europe
one of the retailers like they have like very
basic problems i have a separate application
called skew genie on my other screen that's
scraping the internet and cleaning data
because they have bad digital like this is
just the optometry side of things the retail
like the glasses that you're wearing they
they can't even maintain their database of
like eyewear that they collect so it depends
on who you're talking to some of the chains
are like really advanced like they're not
racket in terms of like um 200 lines of questions
but you have this huge disparity the
only consistent thing is that the people in
the store are using outdated software and
it doesn't know what they're doing so you
have you better make it like **** simple for
them to be able to get onboarded with the
wizard and then and then do everything for them
between hey this is a sorry yeah this this
is a great opportunity to um take on some of
your like um digital project management
like drm and and stuff like that or project
man project um god it's noon and i haven't
meeting yet so i can't think of the term
but those different things like uh salsify
and and things like that that that keep all
of that that digital information but
they're much bigger and have to be managed by
a much larger staff like this is thinking
dam and pams that's that's what i'm looking
for um yeah so so it it does that for a
smaller business it's that's a it's an
awesome It's an awesome concept that makes it
a lot more automated.

> And in writing a
book, it actually made its own website and
made a hero page for it and started to build
like a lot of things that you would see
subsequently if someone was writing a book
and thinking about marketing and it it
it uses the same tools same mcps but you
know just for writing the book it did about
3 000 perplexity searches um in order
to do research uh and pull different information
in so quick question here john quick
question for you so and and say if we
think about the the web page that wrote did
you specify that in your in your prd spec
that it needed to do that no i just told
it to write a book i can even show you the
prompt the prompt is somewhere in here it's
pretty big essentially i told it it needs
to write a book this is the topic which is
uh ai uh did ai is a digital divinity um
and then a uh it needs to you know pretty much
deliver 15 chapters so yeah because you
know the the that's awesome the the people
in the foundation you know one of the things
that i i'm a product management lifetime
career pm guy right a lot the big problem that
a lot of people have and you you've already
figured this out it's the first mile is
that you you have to really specify a great
parity spec that and give that to your agentic
coding system that you've detailed out
what it is you want it to do and that's the
first mile problem so a lot of people would
appreciate seeing your initial you know your
initial kickoff first mile spec problem
Reuven i have to hand it to Reuven his cognitive
diversity i think is what you called it
yeah like it gave me this it gave me this
idea to essentially use scoring and a mathematical
way to actually push innovative thought
into the LLM.

started originally with sort of just swarm and
then from swarm went into the neural divergent
that's what kind of clicked for me because
you know i like the more creative side
of things and one of the gaps that i typically
see especially around like if you ask ai to
write a book there's there's continuity is
missing and and one of the cool things
about this is it created its own book outline
and as it's going through here it's laying
out this strategy and it rewrote this
probably five six times um how it was going to
actually build the book what themes how it
wanted to do the part that really surprised
me is it built essentially its own
lexicon for the book so it started to equate like
religion and religious terms let me see if it's
up here two different parts of the chapter
consistency this is where it is so clergy
or developers temples or data centers
prayer is clearing ai systems and high priests
prophets scribes it created this really cool
sort of like parallel like way to talk
about topics that is pulled through the entirety
of all 15 chapters.

> I literally am still
working on it i haven't done uh i started it
like yesterday so this is the whole project
itself what you've just described like the
whole brain spinal cord all that no the legion
i would say most of the legion parts have
been a project i've been working on for probably
over a year um and it has different
versions like one uses a computer um and i was
using components of that decision matrix in
this but yeah the the actual what you're seeing
right now i started yesterday just specifically
on the book but the main focus was to
get to if i give you a command i don't care
how long it takes you to do it you need to
figure out how to execute and it has to be
executed at a level of quality that i wanted
at and if you can't do that you're not allowed
to stop until you do and keep it right keep
in mind guys just just um in terms of the
what underpins things like clod flow is and
is the roof fan system which i've uh compiled
as a wasm and then i'm essentially using
the roof swarm system so when you uh install
clod flow and you do slash mcp in clod you'll
see that there's two there's two mcps and
if you want to follow the rabbit hole you
actually should take look at the capabilities
in those mcps because i've exposed all the
capabilities of the the neural network components
of the fast neural network system and the
neurodivergent system which is essentially
a uh forecasting and modeling system so
when if you're looking to sort of do prediction
or learning you're kind of doing this
interplay between the the the custom neural nets
that are being built on the fly, but also a
kind of various types of forecasting and
modeling that use both.

the last chapter. That's amazing. What is this being
used for in practice, John? And is this, have
you open sourced this? I literally am still
working on it i haven't done uh i started it
like yesterday so this is the whole project
itself what you've just described like...

#### Reference 9

> It's fun that you said that
because it's actually a little bit, it's almost
like in some cases, the opposite use
because you're using it to predict and I'm
actually using it to on purpose push different
thought like like instead of predicting it's
it is using the prediction especially
around user intent it's absolutely like what
did the user really mean and and the analysis
and like how to get to that but the the other
um thing that i i i really purposed the
math around was you okay if we establish this
as your normal answer where's crazy and
where is that limit and how hard can I push
you to be different and then what is different
enough that is considered artistic or
like innovative versus crazy oh so you're
actually trying to create neurodivergent thinking
like like someone that might have you
know ADHD versus someone who's autistic and and
then using that kind of mind construct to
that's that's amazing that's amazing yeah
i'm on i'm on purpose creating agents with
diversity mathematically and then measuring
their output to see how far it can be
pushed and then when it reaches oh no this isn't
quality stop it knows this is my limit in
this topic or this thing and then it will
take those agents right wherever the competition
or the ab testing ended and go hey
here's my chapter three off like swarm and an
agent group and then that writes chapter
three and then that goes into like the storage
for memory of like hey here's a a group
that does really well with this thing yeah
you know on a side note oh you know all my
life people are always like you know you're
you're you're weird you're crazy you're
different and over the last like 10 years
or so this idea of neurodiversity has really
come up and it and it turned out that the way
that that you know me or others like us you
know think is isn't isn't necessarily bad
it's actually i think the the it's our
superpower it's our and what playing with ai
does it is makes you look at sort of how you
how you think or how you think others people
you know other people sort of you know
think and and that the the inspiration for
why i even called it neurodivergent was a
kind of homage to that.

what John's showing is like the optimal

> and then you guys i
i i hate to break up this conversation but
i i want to get ocean on here before we run
out of time because i know he's working
on some really cool stuff um we we do have
a bit of an after show week so we come back
and we can dig into some of this uh deep
neural net components but uh ocean are you
are you still and john thank you as always
your stuff's amazing oh yeah uh thank you i let me share my screen great so today
i want to uh talk a little bit about
how to write uh more deterministic workflows
with cloud code and line agi um so first
of all this script that i wrote here uh that
uh it so the only uh customization you need
to do for this flow to do different thing
is the prompt and then uh so that's about I
changed the prompt from analyzing my own memory
NCP usages from Python to Rust for the
analysis part to a vulnerability detector
for establishing packages.

And that AB run says essentially like, I
know I need to change, but before I change,
I need to know where I'm at and what
I'm competing against. and then you guys i
i i hate to break up this conversation but
i i want to get ocean on here before we run

#### Reference 11

> So this is the first
planting phase, and it just telling me that
it started that it's about to run that so
we are at here at a so we just kind of
entered this security vulnerability and then
we started doing the plan part so this plan part
will generate three dynamic plans depending
on depending on the context so first
plan will trigger um parallel parallel analysis
and then depending on the result of those
and then we'll do a complexity assessment on
uh which route of path it continues to move
on if it's uh score certain thing was we'll
trigger four agents and if it goes further
we'll trigger seven agents and then every
single agent here is a separate cloud code
session or if you it can be replaced with any
agentic processes so can theoretically uh
switch to Gemini CLI and then after the third
after this run gets finished all of those
results get synthesized back to the original
orchestrator which then you can simply do a
cloud dendrocy dash c and then the same come
uh the same orchestration session gets continued
within the cloud code that is uh
basically the whole flow here so what i mainly
want to show is how this plans gets created and
then how these plans can be modified very
easily via the agent.

screen, I'm going to have to manually allow you
to share your screen um there's no white
boarding or anything like that enabled hopefully
and uh hopefully that doesn't happen again
but again thanks for everyone that presented
last week and i apologize it just because
it's a little bit uh a little bit yeah a
little wasn't wasn't a good way to end the week
but stuff happens i'm to be honest i'm
surprised it took as long as it did for for that
to be a problem for us um but onward and
upward the the who do we have today uh rob we
got uh so we got uh braun field walker and
chris barlow this is uh this is the week of
dashboards abstraction layers over swarm
orchestration so lots of really cool variations
and ideas about about how to accomplish that
and what the visual priorities are so uh
really looking forward to that i was on with
the nvidia guys this morning about about the
production support too roof so there should
uh there should be some some good stuff coming
from that and um uh yes and just a note uh
we had indianapolis last week cornelius and
brad um were there and uh good turnout great
great bunch of folks denver is up for august
13th and then uh august 12th uh the next
toronto event so lots of stuff going on there
and i know someone said they ordered a ton
of t-shirts make sure you use the right font
guys this this is not the right font for
agentics every time i put on my shirt i'm like
ah i'm a font guy what can i say just let's
let's just make sure uh let's let's make sure
we we stay on brand for that i'm probably
the only person in the world that cares about
fonts but the only fonts i i dislike are
comic sans and that one from avatar whatever
that that font's called but otherwise we're
good to go um all right so yeah lots going
this week have you guys noticed that the cloud
code has been uh down a lot with the 529
errors i'm getting that almost uh now actually
most of the morning and what was interesting.

So you get a little dashboard. You can see
what's happening here. There's a swarm
capability. This is a work in progress. And for
anyone that's actually interested in trying
it, you can go to the Claude-flow GitHub and
take a look for the agentic flow branch.
And you...

#### Reference 3

> So if I wanted to go
to the bottom here and say, stop and then do
something else, I could actually click the
pause button and then redirect it to do something,
fix something alter something in real time
so again i'm getting a real-time view of
what's happening here so and now i for it
looks like i might have broke the auto scroll
option i'll fix that later but it's kind of
cool so now i'm going to go back to the top
of the page here i'm just going to stop that
for a moment now i can i can i'm in uh swarm
two so now if i go back to swarm one oh i
guess i'm swarm i gotta do a better job of
showing what's what's happening here so now
can spawn up a different swarm in swarm one or
i can i can create a couple more swarms
here and have them all working together now we
can see a little icon indicating that this
one's running that this this one isn't early
days now you can i also have mcp tools the mcp
tools allows for all the various uh tools
in the system i think there's like 87 of them
and you can you can interact with it so
if i go here and just choose the in it as an
example i can execute the tool now you can see the
success so everything that exists within
the structure of the system that is generally
automated can also be invoked manually or
through apis so if i want to go to like my
github integration i can see all my github
options or my dynamic agent allocation
workflows all that sort of stuff so i click that
we can we can set that up uh two steps we can
say i don't know task execute tool and then
we execute that we can we can view the
memory so this shows all the things happening
within so this one's got a hundred and i
guess 12 i guess that's 12 715 tasks so i
can go in here i can search through that i
can i can type in task i guess there's
something for that one um hope maybe and then we
click on that we can see what what's
happening at each step i can visualize all these
components we'll go for those who like
terminals i stuck a terminal in here just to show
you how to interact with the terminal
programmatically mostly so if you go in here
you can do that you know i can go to cd
oop i gotta test like that right so i could
whatever i need i want to do and here are
the api docs so if you want to interact with
the system you can see that as well so so
this is if for anyone building dashboards
that wants to interact with either cloud
flow or cloud code all you need to do is use
my my web services so you can see my examples
here's some some endpoints so if I want
to check the system health which is the
most simple one I can click here and then I
can execute and this is running you can see
the headers raw the raw information I can
see the web sockets I still do some work
on this one I think I think I need to change
this to my my actual IP address but we'll
see what happens here Oh, yeah, it's trying
to connect to a local host.

actually streaming the output from the system

#### Reference 4

> io was they had like these weird build
system and you had to and and then you had
to try to use the they had a local option to
do the build on your machine and then you'd
have to do the same build remotely but they
get they went away from that and then now
they're more traditional there's still a few
quirks but they all like if you use like um
any any of these ones that uses docker as a
deployment model they all have sort of little
quirks you have to try to work around like
versell is the same way they've got a few
interesting things they've chosen hey thank
you yeah um so who so who wants to show their
dashboard next we've got braun mr field
walker hey og hey how's it going good man how
are you yeah good um yeah when i was working
on swarm i was trying to figure out what
exactly these things are doing so here uh oh
host disabled i can't share i can't share
pornographic images i think i think you have
to request uh let's see it just says
disabled i don't know how to request uh let's see
i think you should be able to grant him
access through if you select on him yeah
let's see here sorry i i locked it down yeah now
when you click share it just says host
disabled there's nothing there at all like it
should say send request now it says okay is all
i got all right if i see **** and and you
know really offensive things i'm gonna i'm
gonna have to flip out but i'm gonna turn it
back on here one sec guys allow turn it on
turn it off yeah join later that's yeah
yeah okay keep keep uh keep all inappropriate
things to yourself today all right you should
you should be good all right let's see you
should see a sparkly screen great nice okay
so yeah as everyone knows swarm and all this
gets kind of confusing so i first started
just trying to say okay what the **** are
swarms there what are they doing so i i i got
this uh sort of drag and drop you can move
them around if you hover over them you can
see what's inside how many agents are there
what their agents are doing i didn't spend
too much time it's like the first thing i got
up just to sort of figure out because if
you ask ai what it'll do is he'll start
drawing all these lines between everything but
they don't exist so it took me a while to
sort of decompose okay what is this warm how
are the agents connected uh are there any hard
rules or are they only rules inside cloud
code sort of virtual brain but i'm seeing
that the screen sharing has been paused does
anyone else see that no i don't know you
can't see anything yeah you still see the i
can still see it no i don't see it at the
moment screen sharing has been paused.

the old so yeah they they've resolved it was
i think they resolved that like in january
so last year it was the biggest issue with
fly.io was they had like these weird build
system and you had to and and then you had
to try to use the they had a local option to
do the build on your...

#### Reference 5

> So, um yeah this is 3d js
i think so um again like what i want to do is
figure out relationships and if i'm going to
build relationships later i want to see
i want to see how and if agents are connected
or do they talk so if you when i first
did it if you just ask ai it'll draw lines
all over the place but when you actually dig
down they don't exist like none of the swarms
are connected at the moment they're all
independent and these i i'd have to update the
actual agents but the whole like mesh ring
star this is a let's call it a mental map for
cloud code it's there are no hard rules that
it cannot break out of so whether cloud
code adheres to these is up to cloud code
but anyways this was just the start then i
thought okay you know this at least tells me
i can figure out you know which one is which
one's up which one's working and you know
what the agents in it.

check on. Yeah, there we go.
Now it's moving. Can you back up?
I don't know. I didn't touch it,
but it went off. Anyways, okay. So, um yeah this is 3d js
i think so um again like what i want to do is
figure out relationships and if i'm going to
build relationships later i...

#### Reference 6

> So just in
case I need to scale something or change
it i needed actual stats for this and then
i got to the swarms most of the swarm are
fire up destroy fire up destroy fire up
destroy so um it's kind of hard to benchmark
and figure out what are the best swarms
what kind of hierarchies work well what what
about your agent so i keep the swarms and i
record them and these are like this is what's
up right now so you know this swarm's got
eight agents these are the names of you
know the title again all of this stuff is
cloud code mental map so these are sort of
made up but you know that's the whole thing
about prompting prompting things like cloud
md everything it's the cloud code tries to
follow it but you get quite a bit of
different configs if you just run a bunch of
swarms you'll see you're getting all sorts of
different configs um so you know i can clean
these up i can delete them i can clean all
of them i can keep them so if i like a
swarm i can keep it i modified route swarm to
I can reinstate swarm so if I use this
ID I can say reload swarm that and that'll
boot up this with all the agents inside then
I got this agent panel so I was gonna make
it haven't quite got there but I'm gonna
add let's call it building swarm so I've
run 94 agents here I don't really need to make
thousands more.

sometimes you're, I have quite a bit of
resource on this, but you know, I can see
my RAM is almost tapped out. So just in
case I need to scale something or change
it i needed actual stats for this and then
i got to the swarms most of the swarm are
fire up...

#### Reference 7

> So then what I can eventually
get is, okay, I only need, you know,
maybe four or five swarms for my workflows,
I don't need to keep building them
and destroying them, I just going to be like,
run swarm one, which will be like, coding
swarm.

I like these ones, I can drag them

the swarm. So then what I can eventually
get is, okay, I only need, you know,
maybe four or five swarms for my workflows,
I don't need to keep building...

#### Reference 8

> history so if you
want to go back a week and go hey what
did i do and what prompts did i use
what did i ask you can get like the
full history and you can search through
it because sometimes you know your cloud
code crashes and you don't have the you don't
hit continue you can just go back and find
out what was going on um and then i got so
that's this is all going back to the ha
pools like when you when i first ran it a lot
of the tasks were finishing in milliseconds
so on the front end it's kind of pointless
to be i'm like why i got a live stream but
i can't see anything that's because i'm
polling at let's say one second and this stuff is
finishing in milliseconds so i was like forget
it uh right now i just dump everything
to the database space and then it's it's
live like these forms will appear in half a
second it's good enough for me so then i i
got this other thing here which is let's call
it the swarm showcase so i a quick quick
quick question are you using the uh the roof
swarm or clod uh flow just all swarm yeah
just pure swarm there's nice this is yeah
because i found because everything is right
now since we're using cloud code everything
is going into cloud ram let's call it right
it you know we compile as many orchestration
layers as we want on top but so far i've
found swarm is more than enough i can you
know because i can if you've got the hierarchy
you you know you've got the agent and the
and the hierarchy and the prompt i don't really
need more layers on top of that right it's
good enough for me anyways um and then
yeah so then i gave um this this what i'm trying
to get is i'm trying to add the neural
net and then add the ability to connect some
of these right i mostly as i've been buried
in the architecture of the events and also
for the agents um you see how these are all
there, there's eight agents, but they're
not active.

here. So if I grab like this one
and hit load, oops, this one loaded up. I can pick the
conversation and then I get my full. history so if you
want to go back a week and go hey what
did i do and what prompts did i use
what did i ask you can get like the
full history and...

#### Reference 9

> and this was the what the swarm
made for itself i again i didn't give it
three prompts i gave it a ****** one line make
me a website so this crazy thing was all
by itself this is like an interactive swarm
builder and i think this one actually looks
better than mine but um i haven't figured out
how to get spinning uh animations into the
3dgs yet but um this is a full like you know
this would be i don't know a 5 grand 10 grand
website if you had to make it and this
thing just cranked this out the whole thing
uh i got features core features i've got mcp
tools these are all the tools i've got this
is nuts the topologies look at this thing
so this is made all a graphic for each topology
hierarchy star you know ring um and then
it's got performance even look at this crazy
performance metric thing so like i don't think
i could have made this myself it would
taken me like i don't know a day or two days
you know like to think about it make it um
and this thing's just cranked this out one
you just pointed it you just pointed it uh it at
the repo i did nothing i i have the repo
i said make use you make me a website about
the repo that's that's the prompt nothing else
zero that's that is that is amazingly cool
like look out this has got a little bar here
right for the different mcp tools and it so
it's it's done like a pretty awesome job
of building this out and it's not you know
it doesn't have ****** fonts and you know like
it doesn't look like if you would not believe
that ai made it by itself with no help
right just organization of content interactive
features like especially these uh the
showcase things right like these these like i i
it's pretty crazy that it could make this ah
itself right it read through the code base
it goes huh what would a mesh look like and
it makes it right it's what's cool is that
it actually figured out that there are these
four topologies which are core to the product
and that it needed to accentuate those
and then like this is better than mine like
i can build you want to build swarms sure
here's a swarm builder right like it doesn't
it's it looks way cooler than my one which i
probably spent a week on it's like huh so
we're getting pretty this is where i was like
okay we're hitting a new level of ai builder
right when when you can build this with one
prompt and it's sort of scary because i've
been web dev for 20 30 years like if someone
said make this this you know probably take
a week in the old days so to do that in 10
or 15 minutes with one prompt i'm like this is
pretty amazing showcase man oh what's possible
yeah yeah so that's it that's fantastic
long story short is i'm i'm still on swarm
and that's i'm just trying to try to get
basically like agent garden and permanent swarm
and then add the what's called the neural
net and then sort of connect them up so so
on this topology though bron um but the when
you imagine the neural net where are the
connections the connections from the center of
the nodes to each node or from the from the
agents to the to the agents that's a kind of
a complicated yeah well that's the thing
figuring out what should connect should you
connect a whole swarm should yeah and then
should you connect agents from your swarm to other
agents or but that's where you kind of need
like the other layer right this is sort
of the playground but and like you're saying
right the Claude engine itself is actually
gets delegated and actually does the work
so you you there's a there's a mini to one
mapping yeah well that's the thing cloud code
is really cloud code is doing everything
you got to understand right that these are
one sub millisecond one kilobyte frameworks
for it they're not this is not a whole bunch
of heavy duty code this is like a prompt that
says you're literally it's like saying you're
a ring and that's it right so it's it's
not what's nuts is that cloud code can follow
it you know like if you gave this to most
llms you think they just forget and you know
it does occasionally cloud code will do too
much let's say it'll it'll do half of it
in swarm and then and then when it gets to a
bunch of tasks it'll go yeah i've had enough
of swarm i'm doing it myself and you know
it's it'll just because it's doing it anyways
so it and yeah you know cloud code isn't
dumb like you can do what's called batch tool
so batch tool would be like no mesh no agents
version of swarm it'll do right five things
at once but when you give it it's like you
know in the end we're all going back to
prompt engineering you know what what was
what is the difference what is the system prompt
for anthropic right it's all it's all
prompt it's so this this is like prompt builder
for batch tool and the best way to build a
prompt builder is to use mathematical systems
and swarm topologies and so i i think this
is great man because this this really helps
people understand what what claude swarm
and claude flow and claude are you know this
is Mentally, getting your head around it
takes a while.

took, well, first one of the things I did
with this swarm is I said, okay, give me a
front end for this repo. That's it. It's a one
-shot prompt. and this was the what the swarm
made for itself i again i didn't give it
three prompts i gave it a ****** one line make
me a website so this crazy...

#### Reference 10

> but until i could prove that
it's more than you know giant these one-to-ones
then um i can't just randomly appear this
is what it's like yeah a bunch of yeah this
is you had a hundred swarms but they're all
just hanging out doing nothing right yeah so
braun was this created with one prompt what
we're seeing here visually was this what
the the output no this this is the one prompt
see this swarm showcase website this this was
the one shot right is it like it actually
would work right now or is it just the ui
no no okay this one is uh live real time
interactive what is your swarm doing how many
swarms you got how many agents you have are
what are what's inside them you know what what
tasks are they doing this is this warm like
what did it do this is the i nuked them but
you know events that are happening so like
when you like rube said with everyone
okay when you use cloud code your screen goes
ballistic you can't even read it so if you you
know i don't really need to do more than
see what the **** was my swarm doing you know
literally and i can't yeah And, Ron, are
you using that output format stream JSON
verbose to get the output?

if you stick to the rules consistently,
you know, on a regular basis, I'll give you a

it's more than you know giant these one-to-ones
then um i can't just randomly appear this
is what it's like yeah a...

#### Reference 11

> I one second is
fast enough for me I just need to see it in
a clean organized you know easy to digest
format and right now what I'm trying to do
like when I ran this I have a thousand events
in like five minutes so I'm like okay I
don't want to see I don't want to I don't
want to see all the events so right now it's
more okay I can get it all but it's like a
tidal wave so I gotta I'm like did you have
to yeah spin up I was going to say do you
spend a bunch of time actually developing
code to to filter the events that you're
actually most interested in yeah the big headache
is that when you get the cloud code hook
it's empty right it's like give you a hook
okay it's a post hook tool and it's on a
keyword uh you know file write or whatever but
that that's kind of it like you you have
to build every single hook you want an event
you want you have to make a custom output
for it right so you then it's like well
i got and then i have like 80 custom hooks
but but then i realized i i don't really want
to bother wasting the time resource or energy
on file read do i really care about file
read maybe not maybe i just want file
right only and so yeah that you know it's all
about figuring out what do you want to see
does it help you at all you know is it is it
that mean you can you can get it all it's
just what do you yeah how does it help what
is it good good is it and then yeah yeah if
you want to control um you know i haven't
got to more control because i have no
problem sort of launching stuff and again my my
account gets disconnected for some reason but
mostly i'm interested in the connections like
this area here like how in order in order
to go from we already got swarms right let's
say we can make eight or ten that's done
right so the next is how do i get you know this
how does this whole swarm work on something
the whole thing not this one or this one
but you know how do we get to let's say mass
or yeah because the the the single swarm is
great but if the next level is i can say
yeah use every swarm here you know this whole
swarm goes nuts so um really really that's
sort of the and then and then we need the
we need the um we need the the neural net right
we gotta have Yeah, my Swarm connected
to your Swarm.

millisecond process, I just dumped to the database
because I don't care if I'm getting, my

#### Reference 12

> and the and the other part that would
be interesting here would be using a kind
of hive mind structure which allows it to uh
stay on point for more complex applications
where you notice after like 10 minutes it
sometimes forgets that it needs to be in a
swarm it would solve that problem yeah i
mean as ocean said how long are we going to
stay with cloud code because all of us know
we're working around cloud code due to the
financial benefits but not long i i've been
working on open code all week to be honest
uh to get away from cloud code but it's
cheap and easy for now yeah exactly so long
forward to that nvidia three thousand dollar
uh well tensor computer well it's a little too
soon to say but our nvidia is is offered
us uh some serious horsepower to test our
swarms on you know it's not three thousand
it's probably three million but the um their
infrastructure they're going to let us borrow
looks substantial and then we can point
the swarm at it so if anyone from nvidia
is on the call let's let's hope they uh they
come through on that um braun this is this
is amazing really good work i love
what you're doing and if you need help
and or contributors i'm happy to jump
in and work on a branch thanks yep
yeah this is awesome has anyone awesome
work bra man it's super
fantastic i love it has brown have you
thought about open telemetry or any of those
kind of hooks or existing observability tool
tool chains i haven't got past any of this
like between all the other stuff i'm doing
um you know i just debated i was debating
how much time should i spend but i'm trying
to the main goal is um getting let's call
the next level of say swarm which is actual
swarm like you know like we you want to
get to 100 or 200 or a million or whatever
because when i first loaded up swarm i
could instance 20 000 agents on you know it
was like maybe 10 megs of ram and it took a
minute but then i'm like okay i can i can
initiate 20 000 agents but what could i get
them to do and who's gonna manage how you're
gonna get you know who's gonna manage
those that's you just So we're almost there, but
you know, like right now we're constrained
by the LLM cloud code has a definite
max at around eight is about its max efficiency.

you can create a share button essentially and
say, you know, hey, Jed, you can contribute
to the capacity or the project or
whatever. and the and the other part that would

of hive mind structure which allows it to uh
stay on point for more...

> and
then you get into there's an you know
there's definitely another level of swarm
orchestration when you get into it's it's like
a flock of a thousand birds or whatever you
get in that kind of thing right there's
other you know i don't think mesh or whatever
is the right one for thousands or millions
right you're getting into uh i haven't even
researched like what's the best way to control
a it's like ants right and probably
that's the best animal i can relate it back to
but when you have a million ants you know
what are they all doing and how do they work
together to achieve their goal so uh we got a
little tiny high but you know again once we
hook up if we can hook up to if we can hook
up the whole agentex .

So again, but once the cloud code is down
and we have unlimited API resource, then
it's just the framework and the system. and
then you get into there's an you know
there's definitely another level of swarm
orchestration when you get into it's it's like
a flock of a...

#### Reference 14

> org everyone brings
their 20 30 even even if we each have a cloud
code but we hook up 80 cloud codes you know
so there are we there's a lot of configurations
and um but it's cool that we kind of
broke open the box let's say right now we're
all thinking about it and you know we maybe
will be the first million first million agents
form you know who knows but uh i think
uh we have the toolbox um and i also took the
because it's called rube fan right so i i
actually got the fan working right now i
can build my own fast artificial neural networks
on the fly with cpu or gpu and they can
um you know that's an actual neural network
so i'm going to try to integrate these with
the neural net and then the mass mass agent so
because you know the anyways there's there's
a lot of layers but it's just round one
i don't talk to me in two weeks or something
when i've had more time i think i think
i think we got to move on to the next uh
demo here i uh i think someone else has a
dashboard they want to show as well we have
a few today we had we had chris barlow but
he's in new zealand and i think i think he's
falling off the call so um we had a open
session there was a comment in there i saw
john petty had mentioned that he's uh that
he has the agents compete with each other
so he'll have a swarm compete with another
swarm and then and i just wanted to hear
that's that's just fyi that there's a consensus
component within the hive mind capability
within cloud flow that that does that
wasn't that does that so and you can monitor
how the consensus within the agents and
how they collaborate with each other and it
basically stores that information in the
hive mind db yeah but i'm curious to hear
what others are doing Yeah, so I took
essentially that function and spawn five different
examples of how they would solve that
problem, have them look at the problem
and propose solutions, as well as the models
will create what they're doing from a
score and prediction standpoint, and then
Claude evaluates them.

#### Reference 15

> uh is a communication
protocol that for those different
agents to somewhat trim and evolve uh so
more of a long-term agentic uh so so say
you have persistent agents that are that
are doing different automations and things
like that actually communicating back and
forth with an orchestrator and if they are less
um i want to say this less um efficient
than another one or or full of errors or
something like that then the orchestrator can
cut that out of the out of the system or
combine or combine two agents into one system
um into another agent so it's it's sort of
an evolutionary um process so it's not
exactly in that same vein but but it it still
has that how do we how do we select which ones
are actually working how do we you know
track that and how do we you know have them
challenge each other i think it's just a
different perspective a different angle for
that amazing that's that's so i love this
this is so i think i like the way Watching
you and the rest of the crew building these
things, I think it just inspires me to
take it further.

training the model in real time right
um i so i have an experiment for that
that's actually in the background right now
running on my 50 90 on hierarchical neural
nets and i used so i haven't been able to
use the whole framework yet i'm kind of like
still just starting to piece this together
but i i created a similar tool to what
Reuven created in this that we that I called
nano agents and it was actually for our
product um so I took sort of like the nano
agents and combined it with what Reuven did
and with the ML models and ran that as
essentially like semantic scoring on the front
end and that semantic scoring um helps
steer the hierarchical neural net at its chunking
layer at the first input and then uh
i'm sorry at the tokenization level level
essentially like at the but well because
hierarchical neural nets work off of uh bytes um
so smaller than tokens sure yes yes yeah
so it actually makes it easier and also it
also makes it inherently multimodal because it
works at that level so yes um but mainly
my experiment was to see can i in real
time influence a model as input is coming
in it added about 0.

it's it's created my test infrastructure
it's created a new collection it's testing
it's doing my market information and it's
doing integration so this is a um a trading
algorithm i won't go into details because
you know i probably shouldn't be showing this
but anyway what we're going to go here and
i'm going to quickly create a swarm create
a five agent swarm and by the way i can
also do this by and oops let's i can do slash
you can see that i've got different options
i've added here but i'm i'm not going to
bother with those right now because i'm just
going to do something And we create a five

#### Reference 5

> um any idea how
i clean that blue thing off my screen
this is a first my chris voice put it on there chris are
you guys that i i am either the
ones to see that no no no it's okay
yeah we all anyway it's okay well didn't know
the blue line i'm not sure what that is but
anyway there's also a so to to give a little
bit of introspection what i've done is I'm
still working on this is a work in progress
for anyone and you cloud flow and you can
do help and in this case we can if we we
see how we get different options we've got the
ability to look at you know various statuses
so we can go to the memory memory and
then we we can see the various queries we can
we can do lists and this gift this will help
you sort of get an idea of what's happening
i've also got this for agents and tags and
types so in this case oh i didn't do memory
let's do let's go back let's do memory memory
so this is showing all the different
things so what i'm and this and my memory
system is is actually the most rudimentary memory
system i could possibly invent there's no
vectors there's no well i've got an option for
sqlite but generally it's just it's just
json and of all the things i tried the json
structure was actually the best it worked
it was simple it was easy it allowed it
allows the system to sort of understand what
what's happening oh it looks like i my swarm
crashed my instance let's go back here and see
what's happening and all right do you
have the orchestrator running in one of the
terminals yes it's running right here so this is
you can see it running this is the system
the the system invokes the orchestrator itself
as part so the so clod code invokes the
orchestrator and the memory so you don't go
clod clod flow start yeah okay got it yeah
exactly exactly and i guess i i apologize
guys i have no idea how to get rid of this
blue line which is is a little strange um all
right guys ruben uh yeah in your cloud test
repository you laid out the four steps right
just so that all of us understand i think
there's a bit of variance here so first
step is cloud code install which we understand
obviously cloud flow your reinstall but in
order to get started did you you said you have
to invoke a dangerously dangerous permissions
do you do that from cloud code for
quote yes i do and and i think what i'm going
to do i'm going to i'm going to just update
this quickly so errol let's let's do it real
time it's just a command line option it's just
a command yeah it's a command line option
right so here so the problem is run
cloud flow start the orchestrator so what i
need to do is i need to add another step step four
we'll make oops step four and what this
what we need to do here is we need to do clog
and then we need to do uh what i think i
have this in my memory so let's grab that game
run dangerously this one yeah and and then
i then what you need to do is you need to
accept the UI warning message, then you can
run the orchestrator.

modes, and each of these modes can then be
invoked directly within the sort of swarm
itself so you can do swarm it's like i don't
know what i call it like subtasks within
the swarm it's kind of and so the so the
additional the addition of mcps within the swarm
really kicks up the the capabilities and
and back to my original comment about you know
hacking and exploitation that is the part
that's most worrisome Because you can
create the swarm that invokes various CLIs and
MCPs, and then you've got the sort of –

> And it'll continue
where it left left off nice room quick
question for you and i've noticed you
know you kind of go for fives like fives
five or 50 like like how do you decide
on how many agents or how yeah how
many like how many unique agents you want
to have going in a swarm like i put in five
and seen what happened like yeah i did of
course of course i did of course i know
yeah it crashed badly um it got to it got to
about 150 and everything sort of stopped.

five or 50...

#### Reference 8

> And I also saw, I saw a little improvement
going beyond five, like in certain things,
like if I was doing like a GPU cluster or
something, having 20 concurrent agents
orchestrating like my hugging face in a
cluster probably would be okay but for most things
i saw zero improvement using 10 versus using
five so i'm like all right i'm i'm gonna
make five the default because most people
have no idea and i just make it easy for
you that was my entire entire thing how do
you measure improvement you say so is it just
subjective or you have some kind the metric
i've met i get benchmarks so i was it
last month i can't remember but i i integrated
the swe bench tool that basically is a
tool that allows you to measure the performance
of the software engineering agents and
then i then i used the swarm against that
agent and i by the way i got 100 on that swe
bench i didn't fail once so it's and and then
what i did is i said how many of these can
i do concurrently and then i just kicked it
up a notch you know and i started doing 50
or whatever and then i tried to do like 5
000 and it's funny you know alex's point i
do seem to like fives but um yeah and the
other interesting thing 100 100 completion
on swe bench it never failed once nice i'm
gonna take us to the speaker component their
guest component roof um let me see if
that's uh if that's good that's good
let's go all right all right so uh first
off we got ****** ****** v3 and the
new york city crew are with us hey ******
hey jad hey guys you're on mute there hey what's up
everybody can you see us all in the

> and today we kind of
again had a much more closed view where we
had some demos back from some of the couple
of the participants about work they had
attempted using the frameworks and then we
did a workshop of broadly very basic uh starting
with basic of spark original spark to
like bits of the swarm architecture um we
we also were not the demo gods went very
favorable to us because we did it remote today
but that is a summary but Benz please add if
I have missed anything please yeah the learning
is that we don't we shouldn't use
Microsoft Teams on live stream events because
it carries the GPU completely but yeah it
was great and people telling us you know
the demand for learning and agentics is
incredible there was a A friend of mine from

of the participants about work they...

> And the challenges that we have is this
perception that a lot of these models are sort
of you know inherently smart right and can
do and act and they none of these things
as we know from agentic as being agentic
engineers that requires guidance like whether
it's a swarm you know operational source
constructs i think that the the building blocks for
agi will emerge from the tools like the swarm
components you were you were seeing
earlier and how we sort of orchestrate and and
use those in a kind of feedback you know a
perpetual feedback probably you know what
what are you thinking what are you thinking in
regards to like what AGI even looks like when
when you're describing this to a government
or an organization well I mean uh from my
perspective AGI like how I explain it to
them is uh it's not like uh explaining like
artificial consciousness or anything like
this it's a simply uh saying that AI can do
anything that we can do and you know and and
that's it like uh be it like a swarm of
agents or be it like some kind of like a
combination of tools and others uh the thing is
that the fact what what you guys are achieving
already and i'm also achieving similar
things now uh uh is is that that it's a
testament of this aga happening like like
literally uh we can multiply i mean rube you have
showed like multiple times like how many
people's work and we can now do with ai i
mean that's literally explaining how the ag
is emerging uh so it's yeah mikko you know
public sector is great but i think one of the
underserved areas is the smb sector because
the problem with smb is they don't have
enough money they don't they don't like now
i'm helping one of the smbs but neither none
of the big players really want to speak
directly to them so they are true resellers and
others right but they are the backbone of the
economy to be honest i think there is a
huge opportunity to actually engage and
them better to something seminar I think yeah so the funny thing is that
a lot of the problems for small entrepreneurs
is coming from like all the obstacles
and government practices and other things
that are making their lives hard like in
unnecessarily difficult ways I'm actually working
on multiple initiatives already with the
government that are making it easier to
be an entrepreneur in this country you know
so I mean a simple thing like for example
automating the process of registering a company
or doing filings and other things like
completely for some reason we do have some parts
of the government that are completely
automated one is taxation I guess like anything
that makes money for the government is
instantly automated because it makes money
faster for them but you know when it comes
to like supporting entrepreneurs uh we
have a filing time for a company um it's like
about three to four weeks uh like you file a
company you get get it registered in three
to four weeks and it costs like 370 euros
to do do like a limited company and then estonia
does the same thing in one day and 50 bucks
uh so i mean i see i see a lot of room
for improvement and the same thing is is true
with that with all the accounting uh which
is a small business benefiting thing like
what if what But if all the accounting was
basically trivial or free for most of the
entrepreneurs, it would take a lot of burden
out of the next.

And in my opinion, that isn't going to happen
from a statically defined language model
that sort of, you know, is responsive, right?
And the challenges that we have is this
perception that a lot of these models are sort
of you know inherently smart right and can

> um well i've been i've
been trying to optimize fair of mine but
essentially what it is is i took spark right
and then i was seeing you with spark doing
amazing things right so i was like okay so
rUv is orchestrating or managing all these
workers so you know and he's and he's walking
it through the spark process so i was like
okay so fair of mine essentially let me
replace rUv with like 10 orchestrators right
and i'm like okay now i got these orchestrators
they orchestrate out the whole spark
process like or the development process like
end to end it's like that's cool what do i
need now to make this better i need to put
rUv back in the loop right but instead of
having to say rUv as say the manager of the
workers i now have him as the ceo the manager
of the managers right and so that's essentially
what i've been messing with lately is
figuring out how to best input put the human
back in the loop to make the system align best
with user intent and that's been a lot of
fun but it's the same problem I was addressing
earlier when I said that when I do a 50
agent swarm I sometimes lose the ability to
understand what each of the agents are actually
doing during that process so you're trying
to add the kind of introspection as part
of that yeah with like goal clarification steps
mutual understanding documents and then
like anytime that you tell the ai something
it has like a separate database that stores
all your ideas so that's more aligned with your
focus so it doesn't ever go back and do
stuff you told it not to do before again type
of things like that that's really interesting
because you think about big organizations
and how they do that right now you know
they're typically in one of these enormous
collaboration suites right so that is actually
where they would expect to see those sorts
of conversations and and that's actually
where the existing humans whether it be senior
manager or CEOs and what have you would expect
to collaborate with a mixed team of system
actors and human actors working together
and indeed where the interface points
currently already are like people would you know
whether it's Microsoft the Microsoft Azure
platform or obviously Atlassian or an IBM thing,
they would expect to see them in Laskow's
collaboration suites.

> and i think
there's just so much going on and and the
the buzz around the swarms that we've
created has really hit a fever pitch half the
world basically thinks it's complete and total
bs the other half is like what so i think
i think it's uh it's exciting that regardless
um today we've got a uh who do we got lined
up by the way today uh rob we got a couple
demos uh one from ocean by ang lee and then
as well from jed arden they both happen to
be part of the team that's been working on
the cloud flow with you so uh it's going to be
neat to see what kind of stuff that they're
building and also hear about new york city
last night big event downtown new york
city had to turn away unfortunately a lot of
folks uh that were there but uh packed event
and good fun so we'll hear all about that as
well and we we also did an event in toronto
this week and that was also a really great
event you know and i think the key takeaway
a couple things i think we've learned in some
of these meetups and we have meetups coming
in orange county and i think indianapolis
we get paris coming up another london i think
i think we have some of the folks from finland
on that are looking to do something there
so we've got them happening all over the
world the one thing that i think we've noticed
a couple things one when you do a free event
you have a tendency to have a large no
-show so if your venue uh can hold let's say
100 people just around number then you're
probably going to want 200 people registered
just to throw it out there so just uh just
as an fyi the the other thing that i think
with the other learning we've taken is um you
know having a structure it probably works a
little better than sort of free form and we
we've had a couple different approaches
which i think loosely sort of looks at like an
unconference style where we we put up a a kind
of whiteboard and you can sort of see
you know what does the audience want to learn
and then ultimately i think what everyone
wants to see is a kind of how to someone somewhere
should show the art of the possible if
you will and it doesn't have to be as complicated
as the stuff that i have a tendency to
show but show show something don't tell if
you can i think would you agree rob is that
kind of the the learning so far yeah that's
that's the perfect blend everybody gets a
chance to touch on some different topics maybe
you've got some uh folks from the community
who want to do some demos of things that
they've built and then absolutely something
that is really uh instructional uh how to
yeah is uh it's just that's a great format for an
evening yeah and do we do we we have a
few folks here online from the new york event
last night jed we have zohari and how'd that
how'd that event go it went well for our
first event in new york a lot of interested
folks and it helped me recalibrate what
median means when it comes to llms and
ai medium median okay what so what does
that mean we are that far ahead we we aren't
or are we the agentics organization are
that far ahead when it comes to developments
in AI.

create a and and spawn a swarm so in this
case for those that aren't familiar mpx clod
at alpha and i'm just gonna do version i just
pushed a new version like half an hour
ago so i think we're on version 44 so i'm
just oh did i break it numpx oh no i didn't
yeah sorry hello there we go version
44 looking good so and then we're gonna
do swarm uh start five agent test uh
swarm in parallel Actually, you know
what I'm going to do before I do that, I'm
going to re-invoke my, I'm just going to re

#### Reference 8

> I'm just going to double
check that actually works yep so now
what i'm doing is i explicitly tell to use
alpha i might push to push it live later
but that's okay so you guys again are my
focus group so now i'm going to go back here
with swarm swarm uh spot and five agent
test uh in in parallel and i often will say
that even though it knows doing parallel
I just feel like I need to tell it to do
it again to to verify and fix any issues now
what you're looking at here is an
interplanetary communication system I know it's it's
crazy but whatever um here we go so I'm
gonna I'm gonna go here and do that so we can see
here it's initializing here's some details
of it we've got some swarm coordination
instructions injected in the cloud code now
this takes a second to to initialize it's
going to set up the the memory structures and
others and and the fingers crossed it works
I didn't break it too bad you know this
morning so we're we're uh give we'll give it a
second to do its thing it's taking it's
probably taking a little longer I might
have to log into cloud code again let
me just double check the clause working oh
here we go okay so it looks good it's using
the mcp and one of my mcps is failing isn't
it don't worry about that oh of course clod
4 i maxed out my clod my opus 4 but to be
honest sonic 4 is fine all right so now
we're seeing the clod flow initialized
so what's happening here is it's using
the mcp to basically initialize and you
can see some of this stuff in the in the
dot in the swarm memory so i'm exposing
it there's more work i need to do
with the memory system But basically, I've
separated the memory for both the Hive
and the Swarm to two different systems.

alpha i might push to push it live...

#### Reference 9

so as we've been working on the
distributed autonomous agent, and you've
been mentioning a lot about QDAC, so
I've been very curious on your architectural
decision of including DAA into
the Swarm itself.

it didn't actually do tests. So
now that it run for a while, it'll
do its thing. But that's essentially
how it works. Rob, can I? Sure. Yeah. Yeah,
so as we've been working on the
distributed autonomous agent, and you've
been mentioning a lot about QDAC, so
I've been very curious on your...

#### Reference 10

> so the capability
manager it gives a token for every agent so
one problem we see in cloud flow is every
single agent including the task agent have the
same access right to all the resources all
the ncps and that a lot of time is not ideal
so for example right now like we're using
swarm patterns the main cloud code become
an orchestrator you do not actually want the
task agent to have similar access rights
as the task agents and so i had this idea
because the access world was very fussy to me
back in february when the ncp become very
hot and people were discussing all kinds
of new attack services area that can arise
from using ncp um so i thought how about we
design something that can mitigate that from
designs for example like rust can completely
eliminate memory leak just by design so
i um so that finished working in two weeks and
then this got approved which i was very
thrilled about because it showed that my
implementation has so many gaps that were
not as how i thought it would be even though
it kind of works but it so i think this is
where we go from like vibing to things working
to you know things are actually good uh
and solid and then i really like a term
that Jeff coined today called agentist.

properly society punishes them in
increasingly severe ways yeah I am trying to write a paper breaking up a little bit Martin welcome back
by the way and I saw we have Chris Royce
on the call what crazy things have you
built like recently here I'll share
real quick so i took your repo
and then re-devised it and added in a bunch
of cool stuff i thought would be cool and i'm
building it out but you basically got a
dashboard you can just start up all your agents
super easily you got a little nlp thing
to talk to them and control them and um yeah
i'm basically taking your clod flow and
adding my little spin to it and uh just working
on something similar yeah contribute it back
guys like we're all just making this thing
better so uh yeah if it's if it's cool and
useful and you know you found my uh
rudimentary ui or you built this separately no
everything is completely separate i just use like
your tech stacks and stuff and like with
the Rust and the Wasm and the neural networks
and all that stuff, but then kind of just
came up with a whole new way of implementing
fair lines.

agenda uh let's see um so we have already
the uh over the first point the introduction
and we're gonna build something with um
ruben's uh close flow um library so it will be
i can hear my my voice sorry through youtube
and i can't mute it anyway um i'm trying
to to you know speak clearly that um we're
gonna start some agentic um app builds uh and
while we are presenting um we we got you know
the swarm will build uh these these applications
in the background and then the end up
to 60 or 50 minutes we go back and we're
gonna uh check what the swarms did for us
completely automatic so feel free to um give
us a nudge how what do you want to build
we have ideas uh what to build actually
so we are prepared because if somebody has
an idea what kind of application to build
uh please reach out i mean on a chat or voice
please tell us some ideas and And then

uh i will go headlong into it but i just
wanted to um just again briefly share my screen
and say that it seems like most of us have
experienced i think you can still you can see
my screen now probably again so looks like
almost everyone probably have a level of
understanding of agentics ai and world flow which
is great so it has it will be exciting

want to achieve at the end of the remaining

ideas anyone has what do you want to build we
have got ideas we're going to kick off but
if you have some ideas we will help you get
started as well if you have not done that before
so please fill this up at the moment he
says please wait for the presenter to change
slides so i don't see i only i only saw that
first question on the mentee on the mentee
on the mentee stuff yeah yeah so what about
now do you see it now i have gone to the
second slide now uh i'm learning yeah i'm learning
as well so apologies um if it doesn't work
we're not gonna waste time here i think
whilst we wait for your responses feel free to
put it on the uh zoom chat as well like what
you want to achieve by the end of today's
session and also if you have any ideas to build
today put it on the chat if mentee is not
working but at this note maybe once we hand
over to denis for the first member spotlight
denis probably would five ten minutes be
okay with you yeah yeah as long as you can
give me um all right so um yeah let me just
quickly put it my slides right and um and and
basically uh what i kind of want to just
quickly talk about right is i did this presentation
recently there's the videos online for
a bit longer um and uh and basically is you
know again like you know like i i'm actually
i call it like i want to talk about mcp
security right because i think you know it's an
important topic right although you know i i
am full on here right i'm basically if you
guys can see my slides right you can see the
slides uh yes we can see there's a different
tab which we have to click for those who are
not familiar but yes we can see yeah you
can see the four setups right stuff yes yeah so
basically very quickly i came from a developer
background from the spectrum generation
and amiga i've i've done security i was a cso
up until very recently and i'm i'm full into
gen ai now i'm working on four startups
everything i do is open source i'm building a
bunch of open source projects which i you
know maybe i should cover that next time because
i think they provide a lot of foundations
and uh and this is the stuff i've been
working on cyber boardroom my feeds and two style
startups which i'll cover a bit later on
you know other topics uh what i what i want
to talk quickly about is by the way everything
i i'm going to say here it looks like i i'm
basically maybe putting a bit down on on mcp
but actually i think mcp is pretty cool
very amazing in fact there's a lot of
capabilities and um you know but it's a pretty crazy
thing right and uh and i want to look very
quickly about this mcp is an api you guys
know this right and i i when i was doing this
i kind of come up with this interesting
analysis which is i think mcp is what the swagger
guys these guys here should remember that
and for the old enough remember the wsdl right
yeah uh if they saw this amazing presentation
by brett victor which i highly recommend
and brett victor is amazing right you know
not just inventing on principle this is great
presentation where he talks about api should
negotiate and talk to each other which is
kind of what we want so let's so they basically
ask these questions hey what if the api
was dynamic and fluid what if the clients
were able to dynamically load the apis what if
the server was able to communicate back and
forward what if the api was able to change
definition and this is all great right and
amazing features from a development point of
view but i think on on on the asian world this
can be quite dangerous and i still feel that
there's a there's a space for agents in
the swarm world i think ruben you guys are
doing but more in a real world right at least
some of the practices some of the activities
you want not to say that the swarms are not
real world but in others i actually don't think
we want agents the way you describe it
right now i think we need much more contained
very well mapped agents that actually it'll
perform very specific workflows right especially
because now we're dealing with this kind
of stuff right and then they really didn't
ask what can go wrong with this right so
very quickly mcp allows you to have this client
server host you guys know this stuff the
client asks what you want to do the server can
communicate but also the server can talk
back to the client which i thought the more i
looked at this the more i was going like man
this is so ripe for ***** that's not funny
right um the client literally can ask what
you support which is great which by the way
this is the first blind spot right because you
can do all sorts of injections already here
and then the server tells this what i want
and you talk to each other and then but
there's also this very interesting uh server
to client communications which i think is very
very dangerous right again very powerful
right but you need to be aware of this because
again you want to make sure that your systems
survive the real world and don't get exploited
left right and center right which they're
starting to be by now right so this is one
of the things that is very interesting but
it's also ridiculously dangerous and i actually
think there's a lot of interesting innovation
to be done here which is just even in
the first step of how do you know which
tool to call right and because you know you
cannot give it to all all the tools but that
doesn't really scale so this is the first part
And by the way, there's strings everywhere,
right?

little bit complicated at some point, but always interrupt us on
the chat window if you don't understand
the processes. And we're going to have
a look at getting rid of a little bit of
cloud code anthropic models and but we stay
inside anthropic and um we're gonna use...

#### Reference 4

> can you ask the user this or can you log
this at your end right all of them are you know
dangerous situations right again you need
if you're aware of it then you you can
protect against it right yeah what can go wrong
with this stuff right um but then you know
this is just some workflows you guys on
your talk you know this you know that right what
i think is interesting is this right and what
i was just showing here was that the
idea of a request and sometimes i think we
miss a little bit this on some of the conversations
is that the prompt contains everything
right and sometimes this gets a bit hidden but
your prompt usually when you get sent contains
the first question the second and the
third and the fourth and the fifth although yes
this can be exponential he does so the way
the other lamps does they compress some of
this stuff right so after a while you get
some compression going on but your prompt still
has all the stuff on it or a lot of it and
this is part of the problem when you look
at MCPs because the problem is strings right
and by the way I would I ban strings now for
my code base and i recommend you guys to
kind of do the same thing right because a string
is a freaking gigantic thing right of four
gigabytes or more right of all sorts of
characters right so i use stuff like this in my
python code which is strongly type strings
so a more accurate view is this so everything
right here is potential injection right and
then when you look at mcp world what happens
is the host goes to the servers and going
hey dude what you got we got a list of stuff
right and then they get all these lists of
tools so basically if you look at this loop
this is just the mcp host booting up and
then get a nice list of the tools and then
which is basically they can handle these flows
and then this is what happens right you get
an instruction that basically the host then
goes and figure out what to do this is again is
very dangerous picks the right tool makes
the call and then figure out are we done
yet loops and loops and doves and there's
these things right the problem with this right
is every one of these places a place for prompt
injection and i mean if you have seen
recently people have been putting prompt injections
in all sorts of places google docs dns
records web pages you know responses all sorts
of places right so i think this is really
interesting the problem is that we need really
need to beef up our infrastructure right
in order so that this is not a problem right
because uh yeah there's some exploit parts
here which is i call this can you can you
llm for this so you can uh this is the server
to the client right you can attack uh you can
attack the user directly because you can ask
the user questions again very dangerous
and can you in inject logs into the client
stuff which is again you know another place for
indirect in fact this could even have prompt
injections on the admin interface which
is very powerful right and and this is the
crazy feature right the llms can actually change
the definition on the fly which basically
means that if you don't log everything like i
was mentioned a second you have no idea to
even be able to reverse engineer what the ****
just happened right after after the fact
right so the problem to defend is and this
is what i think there needs be a lot of
innovation and i actually think each of these is
a it could be a separate company or it could
actually be an api workflow and i actually
think that even the swarms you know they
handle some of this but i think we need to way
improve these capabilities which is we need to
log everything post data we really don't
have good identity access management for our
agents we really need better identities we
don't have solution for projection os has massive
gaps most databases don't have integrity
and transaction and that's a show left
front and center and we still don't know how it
works apart from that right it's what can
go wrong right um but that's what i think i
really want you guys to think about and and the
way i handle this is using semantic graphs
and creating state flows and and basically
in a way limit a lot what the lm can do and
in a way what i like about the swarm stuff
is i like this idea of evolving going very
wide and then going very slow right very small
i like this idea that you can start with
very wide LLMs that show you the art of the
possible and then you experiment experiment
and then you start to have smaller models
some of the stuff that again Ruben is doing
with custom models like unique temporary there
are interesting but I like my models to
be all customized and eventually you might
even arrive at code that does that or you
have very limited places where you use the
LLMs so that's kind of my approach right it's
about making stuff deterministic and some
of these things you know you just can't control
at the moment and I still feel that the
way we should really be controlling a lot
of this is through identity access management
so that you almost have real-time identities
real-time privileges so that even when the
stuff goes over the place the actual agents
cannot do this and i think we get this
right and the agents will be a lot more
successful because there's a lot less areas for
damage and that's kind of it right it's all
nice you know let's accelerate thank you
dennis i think great i think i'm basically
um look requesting the members if you have any
questions on what we have heard please feel
free to drop them on the chat i guess what
we'll do is that we'll quickly move on to
the build before we go to the next member
spotlight and then there have been a number
of great ideas on the chat so you could
follow along um in the interest of time what
i'm proposing and am i okay to share my screen
again yeah you are you are showing a screen
now am i showing my screen okay it's a
bit confusing what is happening here are you
okay i can't see your screen you can see my
screen you can see my i can't it's nothing
uh i can london agenda doesn't be there all
right yeah yeah sorry so i was driving my son
to his tuition lessons this morning and i
realized that i went too much in a hurry
and i did not set up my navigation on my tesla
right and then what happened by the time
i set up the direction i realized i was
already on a route that had a lot of traffic so
i waited in the traffic for 20 minutes so i
said and i thought like i was thinking
like what do we build today so i said well
maybe this is a good use case so could we have
an app that i could just specify the
destination as i get ready to leave home and it
goes about and looks at traffic information
from public sources and recommends the route
i should avoid right so i said you can mock
up data maps traffic geolocations just help
me demonstrate this idea in the spirit of
building is the new talking motor which
i'm trying to kind of socialize and that we've
got this session today i want a prd but this
is ravi back to your question how i approach
it that will help me use the ai system
to create a realistic application so i just
use gemini here right so as we say created
a plan and i have a prd here which talks
about interestingly uh it gives the problem
like unpredictability of the familiar journey
uh lots of stuff i will open source this
so you can have a look and interestingly it
also creates a vision i mean which is expected
but it creates some persona which is
interesting i never asked it to create a persona
which is basically alex tech savvy parent
um you know basically chloe the hybrid
professionals lots of frustrations about last
mile problem etc etc and then tuition run it
picked that up so what i've now done and
is just a very quick question i've got two
instances here just to show you how to get set
up i have set up one properly which is um
does anyone not know here how to set up
Claude Flow and Claude, is there anyone here
who doesn't know that?

me? can you ask the user this or can you log

dangerous situations right again you need
if you're aware...

#### Reference 5

> What this is doing,
what Claude-flow really is, again is it's got
some commands to make lots of agents spawn
and do work in a very coordinated fashion
and you can please feel free i have created a
tutorial on it if anyone is interested it's
work in progress so please provide feedback
and help improve it if you go to my repository
which is github.

I'm pasting that and running it. Now
you will see lots of files are going to
get created on the left-hand side. Okay
to proceed? Yes. What this is doing,
what Claude-flow really is, again is it's got
some commands to make lots of agents spawn
and do work in a very coordinated...

#### Reference 6

> from here on we can
actually um we'll create something so before i
go to that what i had also done is you know
the deep research we did i converted that
into an md file and that md file is here
and what i'm doing here is i'm saying i want
to build an application live along the lines
of the requirements in that document so use
the at the rate symbol like here if you i
can't go up i can just show you probably very
quickly by going down there again sorry
if i'm repeating i'm just trying to keep it
very basic because some people may not have
seen it so what did i do oh yeah that's fine
so if i remove that you see when i use at
and i say prd it detects that and i say just
press enter we have around 40 minutes to
complete the exercise it is meant to educate
and at the same time build something that
is realistic and can be trialed or assessed
using my laptop here what should i use the
reason i ask that question is for a reason is
that if you go back to the cloud flow there
are two ways we can do things one is called
the swarm mode the other one is the hive
mind command which means you have a queen agent
which coordinates in hive mind for more
complex issues so i'm saying you know what
i'm just going to ask you what i'm lazy and
i'm going to just ask Claude, what should I
do?

> **Context:** is the proper one that
I had. This is the improper one I said,
but you see all of these new files
got created here. Yeah, this is how
we get started. from here on we can
actually um we'll create something so before i
go to that what i had also done is you know
the deep research we did i converted...

#### Reference 7

> md file you can modify
i'm just using the out of the box file and
this is the basically secret sauce this
tells ai how it should work so the rules are
defined here there is another course
that i had shown you before which actually
explains to you about cloud flow so you
can go through this course and kind of get
and give feedback now all i'm going to do is
press the enter button now saying i would also
want you to document yeah I also said you
should synthesize etc etc I would also
want you to document how the different agents
work together to build the product that is
necessary so the audience can look at the file
and understand the process better later
on right so if I press enter here and I agree
up here we will wait let's see what it is
this combobulating I don't know what that
means and we'll give five minutes and then
we will switch across to the next member
spotlight it'll build on its own but i want to
get the process started with yourself it says
i will use a swarm approach as it is more
suitable for rapid coordinated development
with clear agent roles so now it is going to
create a comprehensive development plan using
multiple specialized agents working in
parallel so we'll give it another few minutes
so that's the to-do list that's the plan you
see that's it'll create a topology whether is
hierarchical or star or circular is a
ring i think that is called it will determine
so it's going to initialize a swarm with
specialized agents and set up the project
structure so it's doing the work and the reason
this is happening on its own is i said
dangerously skip permissions otherwise i would
have to keep pressing the yes button every
time i'm not doing that one of the things i
think is important to to clarify here right
is that and this is where i use the worldly
maps reference right of explorers villages
and town planners what i think is super
amazing on this approach is that this is about
exploring the art of the possible right this
is not about creating a production ready
material this is not what town planners does
right this is in the early days of genesis
and custom build what we can now do is use
this experiment let these swarms go out
experiment do all sorts of stuff so in the end
you get a really good solid solution and
i think that's when you then once you have
that solution that's when you should you
need to hand over to another workflow where
then is about locking down that functionality
so in a weird way here is where we can afford
to be highly insecure highly experimental
failure here is is a feature of this
solution right and the swarms just allow that
to occur in a much more interesting and
effective and iterative way that's excellent
i think that's a great product idea actually
that you just said denis is this is like
proper adoption of this into into an enterprise
system right so like my ideation to yeah
and if you guys read about the worldly maps
what's interesting about and simon worldly
is amazing guy but he he does definitely
have these interesting concepts of you do need
to hand over because they are different
focus right and i think one of the problems
we're having at the moment with a lot of
these conversations is is both ends are good
but they're looking at the formula wrong side
the this allows us to create very effective
solutions but this is not the production
stuff on the other hand the production stuff
right you know we'll look at this and going
that's not how you create things you go
no but this is how you then hand over right
to the next generation right not generation
next sort of individual or group who will then
really lock this down and make into a product
and eventually make into a commodity right
excellent so what we're going to do is
that it is going to work so instead of looking
at the screen i guess again i guess if
bence you can stop my screen share maybe we
move to yourself for the next spotlight is rocky
here just checking rocky are you here uh
i will message yeah yeah i'm here yeah i'm
here oh rocky uh do you want to go for
between you and bands whoever wants to go
first i guess um i don't mind really i don't
think i'll take that long i've got a problem
with this live stream it's it's frozen uh so
the the obs software what we are looking
at now for the first time is not working
at all it's okay we are recording this
anyways right this is recorded isn't it so
we will do something about it let's not
bother with that i think the people who
are here that's great so rocky over to you
okay one second uh let me just give a 30
second introduction about what you are so
dinner sorry we didn't ask you could you
give a 15 second introduction of you know
i think you did right at the beginning you
did yeah yeah yeah i've been around
doing a bunch of gen i startups and everything
i do is open source so happy to help
and contribute okay yeah well what are
you rocky yeah so hi guys so quick one you
show this recording it doesn't zoom doesn't
say it's recording no it i said on
my side it says it says recording all
right yeah it says yeah i hope so all right
cool all right good shall i get going
yes please rocky right okay hi i'm
joining you from the beach right now oh
no this is like a zoom sort of uh i
don't know how to turn it off i don't
usually use zoom um i'm actually in
the car right now so it's better than
that view i suppose so yeah i introduced
myself i've i'm ceo of a company called kaipe
ability i just started this company last year
and i'm sort of into advanced manufacturing
and for people who don't really know around
advanced manufacturing is cyber physical
systems in manufacturing is how i kind of
describe it so when you see things like 3d printing
multi-axis machining 3d inspection inspection
metrology digital twins robotics ai and
shop floor you name it it's about the
synthesis of all this technology together in
order to create to create value human value right
and symbolic value but I started my own
company last year to sort of to focus on the
trend of reshoring the fact that we struggle
as human societies to really translate
technology from R&D into commercial viability
and scale up right what people call it different
sort of industries use different terminology
I call it the valley of depth and yeah and
then I got involved with the agentics
foundation through roof and that was in january
i think i don't know how i managed to get
involved i used to do some beta testing for
open ai i was asked to be a business fellow
for perplexity last year so maybe just through
some linkedin chat i saw him followed him
joined the brigade in january february time
so that's sort of my involvement with the
sort of program i suppose is that good enough
for you mandeep for an intro perfect perfect
rocky you've got to keep me in check you
know i'm going to then put my timer on you have
got well we'll got 10 minutes i mean i hope
you i think we'll go over a little bit if
uh if you know feel free to drop off but
i'll stay back but we'll not rush it right we
have first time so over to you rocky yeah well
i'll just share what i've been working
on i didn't i don't really share much i'm
not a sharer um on social media i'm old school
i suppose sharing is caring rocky well a lot
of my sharing is face to face through you
know phone calls word of mouth sort of thing
um i'm not really on facebook instagram
twitter or anything like that x so i tend not
to sort of do that sort of stuff but i am
getting more into the ai agentics through roof
as well um sorry i'm on my perplexity one
sec and i am interested in it because the main
issues we're seeing around ai everyone has
a view on ai my view is it's absolutely a
game changer and it's not going away just to
ask can everyone see rocky screen yeah the
github one um yeah all right lovely yeah
so i just started this last uh in january
something my own github i'm not a coder as
such i do basic sort of macro in excel i've
never done python or anything i tried i tried
to do python coding for my energy usage
and that's about as far as i got so something
like Claude code coming up upon us you know
and manas has really been a game changer
for me to sort of take from what's in my ideas
and create prototypes but the Claude Flow
idea it's really sort of sparked a lot of
interest for me in that you know the ability to
have different personas working together and
checking each other's work is a really powerful
tool I see absolutely the future being
having a team if not individual AI agents
within each team who either represent that
team or you know interface with the wider
organization so I think this is going to be a
huge stepping stone in terms of that but but
being a solopreneur you know I've gone from a
corporate environment where you have a lot
of feedback a lot of people in a lot of
departments to engage with just to yourself so
how do you sort of do this in the startup
sort of sense and organization where you
can't afford to hire a board of directors and you
can't afford to have teams working on you
and that's why I think agentics and AI with
agents really is going to be a huge sort of
a game changer for us.

Why? But there is a file called cloud.md
here so this cloud.md file you can modify
i'm just using the out of the box file and
this is the basically secret sauce this
tells ai how it should work so the rules...

#### Reference 8

> So the demo I just
basically wanted to show you is like I said
that the big issue is how do you take my idea
and put it in front of a VC, put it in
front of an investor, a bank you know a research
organization and what it what they always
ask for is a business plan right but with
ai you get you get ideas every single
day right in terms of business plans so to
sort of curate and use a magentic swarm which
can then act as your board and support you
with a business case and a business proposal
is actually quite a powerful tool i feel
right and that's what i've kind of applied
um the agentics form towards do you want me
to go through sort of how or maybe at a
very high level maybe rocky just to show
like because what your linkedin post yesterday
was really amazing so i think it'll be great
to socialize that uh i mean maybe time
limited to five minutes but give us a broad
brush overview so my approach to the ai now
is use every single tool that comes out the box
and use it straight away and that's how
i'm kind of learning so if you come on my
pc i've got perplexity open i've got Claude
open i've got chat gpt still running you know
i've got google i've got like open router
i literally have everything going on at
the same time so whilst comet is filling in
a form or doing some research for me on
something i've got Claude running code i've got
chat gpt working on something else or i'm
typing questions to it and i've got perplexity
doing lab reports for me so it's just like
that's my team right now right and it's saving
me full-time engineers so the way i kind of
focused it for for this project was i saw
a comment from Reuven it's always Reuven
that triggers the ideas saying just ask ai um
you know where do you see yourself in five
years time right and and i say ai chat gpt
and chat gpt has got an edge on other ais
until just actually recently with claude and
that seems to know you very very well through
the fact that it kind of reads the entire
history continuously and uses that as context
so i typed that into chat gpt it says this
is where i see your company going in five
years time and it was just really sort of
brilliant right in terms of how it kind of
forecasts a journey for your own company so
then I said okay let's work on this and create
you know a multi-year plan we did that and
then I said okay now I'm working with Claude
Flow let's create a board pack using a swarm
of agents to do that right for me in order
to create that board pack so i got actually
chat gpt where am i here we go to create
basically my claude md file not necessarily
roofs yet because i haven't got that far
yet to use claude roofs claude flow and it took
out everything that it knew about me and
my company based on previous previous chats
and transcripts and it basically created
firstly what my mission statement my mission
was for the Claude MD it created a board for
me based on my chat history it took out it
created files based on the source data of
what it knew about my company doing its own
due due diligence and I was very explicit
saying there may be information that you don't
actually have and this is where you have to
now use rag and you have to go and use and
find out the information using the swarm where
there's gaps in the information and then
it built my if you can read then it built my
agentic swarm right which which were these
personas so planner orchestrator financial
monitor gtm enterprise architect strategist
etc etc right so you copy you copy all that
put it into your claude md file also put in
your source data in terms of what my financials
are of the company where i am as an
individual where i think my business case is
going what i'm trying to do you know etc etc
which already chat gpt knew about me and then
it overall created my business case
for me and business proposal do you
want to see a bit of that i mean
yes yes please so i made it private
because there's a lot of private
information in you but it but what i've
noticed about it is that i i was expecting
it to fall over right and just have
so much spurious data so much stuff that's
just not relevant missing gaps in
information i know rufe did a demo about some
trading agents and then he was doing the
demo and he was like opening folders and
the folders were empty but i think because
chat gpt supported me in terms of the md file
and also the specific prompt to put into
clode there was literally no folder and
no part of the business case that was left
untouched and checked over right and also
it was ragged and you can see next time
i'm going to ask for some extra traceability
but it basically created an entire
business case end-to-end for me right so
executive summary market problem
what's the solution what's my funding
strategy what do i need to do based
on where i am today what are the
actual financial models you know so
if i just open that you'd expect it
to be empty but it's not it's all
full it's full of actual relevant
information realistic numbers you
know it goes on and on and on right so you
think okay well maybe there's something that's
missing out what about an implementation
roadmap and it's all there yeah what how do
i go from 48k revenue which is where i am
today on a single client to a growth path and
step by step how to do that right and that's
really massively powerful for someone like me
right now let's make a small comment the
thing that's ridiculously powerful about this is
that when you create this you still review
everything right you still read everything
the difference the difference so in a way
this is still your work this is still your
words what you've done was you steer the ellen
lambs to say here is the path you know there's
50 different paths you can go that's the
one i want to go and it just makes you
ridiculously more effective right and also it has
the advantage that now as you progress on
your path you can just go to the LM and say
hey can you just update this based on the
latest stuff so the overhead of creating
this is now ridiculously short yeah right and
that's the key and also what i found is like
you also have like no psychological dependency
on the pain to create this which basically
means that if somebody says hey can you do it
like this and can you change it like this
absolutely yeah you know like dude i just
spent freaking a week right months and yeah
put so much effort into it exactly right yeah
that's the key i think that some people miss
is the fact that you've decoupled almost like
your ownership of this this is just a
physical almost like one representation of your
ideas that you will change and modify and
slice without any emotional attachment to it
absolutely really can i ask you question rocky
there um what what what's interesting i
want to think of where you started from where
you said uh i believe you said that people
can you don't you're an individual sitting in
your car right now but you know you came
from a corporation and and now you you can as
an individual you know have much more leverage
because you have ai essentially just to
park absolutely so the thing i always used to
say when i started the company and i seek
them out through just people mentoring me is
you'd lose that you do lose that kind of
independent mentorship in the board right and
you miss that you know that motivation of a
board motivation of your peers to kind of say
you need to deliver not just for yourself
for the company right it's one thing to have
your wife and kids saying when you're going to
pay the mortgage but it doesn't really frame
your business very well it just panics
your business so to have sort of a board which
is your own chosen board at the point actually
of starting a company not waiting for 10
years down the road where you can afford one
is it's just massively powerful and do you
think so looking at this at the screen right
now i'm seeing hiring um i'm seeing a lot
of things that to me actually are are anti um
so so there's not anti but um anti-ai because
it seems like have created you more of
an old world business plan um do you think
that's the case i'm only just reading the screen
so i'm not yeah i think that i think
organizations are going to exist they might just
not be as big as they used to be because you
just don't need that many no the size grows
inefficiency so i don't think that i'm never
you know i can't run look at i'm saying
i'm running comet i'm running perplexity i'm
running five different ais in one go that
should be five people i can't you can't humanly
do that unless you're an octopus right so i
can't see myself not having specific roles
and people running departments in the future
yeah those departments just may be smaller i
completely agree right i think what we'll see
first of all i think we're need more
developers not less right and also think that
we will see a lot more smaller teams and and
teams that have basically almost as an ability
to operate at a level that today will be
impossible right in the past speed yeah dude
if you went to a team and you said like am
i cyber teams right if i went to them and says
hey guys before you do anything i want a
risk assessment i want a pnl i want a project
management i want structure i want
documentation i want this this this this this they'll
go f you right because they wouldn't do it
right and they couldn't do it because they
didn't have time now we can so i think our
ability to create multidisciplinary teams
and i completely relate to that that ability to
bounce off ideas to multiple personas is
absolutely amazing yeah i mean the thing i
suppose just to bounce off that a bit is that my
first involvement with generative ai was
before chatbots and llm ai because i did we
did a lot of generative design in ai for actually
manufacturing and what happened was the
opposite effect you think you're using an
efficiency tool so you say hey all i need to
do is give my software my requirements and
it's going to generate the geometry for the
product for me i mean how brilliant is that
yeah so if i want to design a screwdriver you
just give this functional requirements to the
software it does all the fea it does all
the material selection it does all the
manufacturing method and it gives you a design but
it doesn't give you one design right it gives
you 30 to 50 designs yeah so now your problem
has actually gone your bottlenecks has
moved right to the human which says now i've got
50 designs different manufacturing methods
different cost models different materials
different geometries now instead of validating
and pushing one through my whole new
product introduction process i could have
30 products i need to validate in one go yeah
but now we can experiment and i think that's
the power the power is that what you can now
do yeah is you can experiment those 30
very fast with a low low cost and then find
the one that actually takes to the next phase
and then you could also experiment on that
it's a change of it's a total change the
game but the labor the labor goes up it just
moves it moves the labor yeah but by the way
the way i've done this which is so so you've
done almost always like go and do me
everything the way i've done this same business
plan which I put on the links is I created
voice memos of every area of the business
plan and then I give it to ChatGPT and Claude
and I created almost every document of the
investor pack and only when I have every
single document multiple iterations is I created
the business plan so I found that by the
time I got to make the business plan it was
actually using my own ideas my own references
on the marketing strategy the technology
strategy the hiring the people etc the
financials blah blah blah blah right and i found
that quite an interesting way it's almost
like you do a brain dump but on the end of
every brain dump you have these ridiculous
well-written documents really just it's just
you know the world's your oyster so that's
it i'm wondering thank you i think uh i
i learned i think i'm gonna probably try
trial this actually this is well if you want
to go let me i'll help you out don't worry
about it i'll show you how to do it because
it's just relevant to me and and i'll
show you how to set it up one thing i did
notice actually which just sort of to allude
to is i was actually at google with um tier
bolt from voice ai and i think that's
the next thing coming believe it or not so he
they were demoing voice agents but having
basically five or six in a room right and having
conversation with multiple ais in
parallel seamlessly yeah imagine that so like now
now instead of uh the next phase will be i
should be able to plug this straight into the
voice ai agents and they will grill me and
ask me questions yeah saying here's your
checklist what where are you yeah where are
you on your milestones what's happening what's
your excuses for not doing stuff um and i
think that's really coming very quickly you
know by the way that's one of the problems
i'm trying to solve the cyber boardroom which
is talking to multiple personas but also to
communicate upward sideways and downwards
in you know with multiple personas and the
persona is not just a person is the person
the culture their role their task what they
want to do right and i found some very powerful
cases like you talk about where having a
persona you want to present something and
then seeing what would this persona react to
my information yeah and suddenly you start to
realize that if you want to communicate
for example with board members or executives
or your peers etc you need almost to have
highly personalized focus message to each one
and again now we scale that where in the past
we didn't yeah and actually personas like
that voice ai demos actually suit this sort
of view because board in boards people don't
say very much right so you do the talking
first and then that's where it suits whereas
i don't think you can get this cacophony
of voices at the same time but then use semantic
knowledge graphs to capture that yeah
and that's how i get deterministic improvidence
yeah yeah i think that's going to be the
future yeah so hopefully that's enough for
you yes thank you um again everyone please
leave your questions comments on the chat uh
we will act after the meeting uh let's let
her look at what we are doing what's happening
with our swarm so i am sharing my screen
but it's not showing up here can others see
my screen we're not sharing i think we're
still seeing the previous screen you can switch
the tab on zoom on oh they've introduced
this new feature there is a there are tabs
on the top of the zoom and rockies and yours
you're right there you go yeah that's why i
got confused and by the way benz i think in
linkedin i saw it all people sees my top half
of my face so maybe we are sharing the
wrong pinning the wrong screen on the on the
share i was aware i was aware of that this
is a obs limitation i adjusted now so it's
not cropped anymore okay but there was a lot of
technical problem okay so okay no problem
you have got so a lot of work still ongoing
by the way it's not completed um so i will
let it continue it's still working it's
consumed 1.

and that's why I think agentics and AI with
agents really is going to be a huge sort of
a game changer for us. So the demo I just
basically wanted to show you is like I said
that the big issue is how do you take my idea
and put it in front of a VC, put it...

#### Reference 9

> It's going to fix the error on its
own and continue so i'm not doing anything
do you want to share the screen
oh i am not sharing for correcting
me what about now yep is it any
better so i'll repeat whatever
i was saying because i particularly
asked it to do tdd and things are moving
very fast so i can't scroll up much it's
creating all the test driven develop test first
and that's what is taking it such a long
time but it's at work and as you can see here
is a random basically test file it's using
jest here it's writing all the tests here so
once it does that i think that's where it
is going to it's still working not working
sequential it's still working there's a
coordinator here working and the spark coder is is
active but it's still working i think on the
ts file here it's a test fine here right
so you see that's a few questions you know
while it's doing its thing I've seen that
you know it compacts the conversation at some
point it does and then and also later on it
can do things like oh this test is not passing
I'll skip this test or I'll change the
test so that you know it's it's not going to
fail things like that what's your experience
because I have seen that happening later
on and what is the consistency from enterprise
scenario what you need is consistency so i have
had mixed experiences to be honest and
i'm still learning right so i think obviously
the experts here who i think many probably
people here actually please feel free to
share your experiences but i have been able
to create really sophisticated apps i'm
still on the journey but with a level of
orchestration i see myself as the orchestrator so i'm
basically monitoring but I would intervene
at some point in time if it is not giving
me a desired view but then it's a it's that
relationship I guess right but it it does
work so today for example I was able to demonstrate
something quite interesting and someone
shared an idea with me yesterday at noon I
had not done anything I kind of all I asked
the person is that just give me a voice
your transcript talk to yourself give me a
transcript that's all I need did the deep
research and we were able to explain something
to an exec pretty you know convincingly so I
think from a prototyping talking a building
is the new talking that aspect it is quite
mature because you can really get your
point across your point about enterprise
consistency what Dennis also highlighted the kind of
that narrowing aspect I think that's
something perhaps as a community we could look
at to make sure how this becomes much more
easy to and and and consistent so I believe
there's some work to do there anyone yeah my
chris what's your views sorry ravi yeah yeah
my feeling is that the lm itself is not
that important it is the the ability to consistently
digest business context is one aspect
and enforcement of like workflow like github
test-driven development all of that
consistently through the process so when it compacts
obviously that with cloud code basic cloud
code it's worse than it is with cloud flow
um because there is a little bit of
enforcement built in there and then you learn
like prompting you know follow this kind of
events has also shared some prompts you know
in the community in general uh so there's
this but i think i'm i'm seeking for for
teaching perspective a consistent set of practices
if you like whether that's prompts or
whatever else yeah we can collaborate on that so
greenwich university We are in touch with
them for a module starting September.

that's the focus and then maybe next
session I do a demo or show you my my
workflows and so on and and explain
also how i work with low because they
are stuff that make it useful and stuff
that you should be aware of because
they are not quite ready for prime time
so it's important to know what they are
so yeah that's it thank you vincent and
last but not least one of the other
members of our basically co-founding team
by the way anyone others are welcome
to kind of volunteer is chris polter here
who's been doing some amazing work so
chris would you like to briefly introduce
you and what you do yeah for sure for
sure uh so i'm a founder i've been
working on ai stuff about four years now
i guess predominantly for building
stuff and probably like a lot of us
here i'm kind of almost more interested
in the tools and what you're building it's
kind of more fun and interesting and exciting
and constant innovation and and kind of
improvement so i've been on a journey on the
last couple of years trying to optimize uh
kind of ai for coding i guess and yeah the last
six months everything has really exploded
quite a lot i think cursor was the first one
to really make the like a significant difference
to coding if you like beyond the kind of
autocomplete paradigm and then flawed code
really just took it to the next level so a
lot of it is really understanding how you redo
the software development like cycle in the
world of genetic coding right um and yeah
probably at the next call or one of the future
ones i'll be able to show what i'm working
on which is a it's a different type of
orchestration uh tool if you like to to kind of
cord flow uh just from a different philosophical
standpoint if you like um so i believe
essentially in very short iterative loops so
i want to be very controlled about what i
tell the ai to do and i want to validate the
work and then kind of continue from there um
and that's cool when you're working in a
terminal or kind of one but as soon as you want
to build bigger things then actually you know
going through these different tabs trying
to find out where you need to you know approve
stuff or change things and do all that's a
bit of a pain So I'm actually building a kind
of GUI at the moment, which has all the
configuration and orchestration kind of
built in and then basically a task inbox for all of
the agent supervision, if you like.

these models and I use the techniques

#### Reference 1

> So I
don't want to be rate limited um by by clod
but 50 agents is just crazy it it can do all
kinds of things now the the most of
these swarms beyond research i find is like
optimization so i i've been i've been working
on a project where i'm creating a kind
of you know a quantum inspired dark net
and a lot of that was sort of optimization
and benchmarking and basically i create a
swarm and basically pointed and said give
me you know the most optimized version i can
possibly have for for this system and and
then it worked for several hours and
eventually it gave me the sort of final optimized
uh options for it all right so oh the
thinking is working again okay so i this one
the thing is working because i added the
cloud folder so that specifically is relating
to this file the settings the settings
file tells you what's allowed so i'm allowing
all the various things tells you max timeout
rate so if you run into the timeout issue
i i've added that so that resolves that problem
i've set the working directory option so
you sort of might work better time you
know and various other things here's some
automation rules for for my system backoffs things
like that now let's take a look at what's
happening down here all right so now
what what i'm testing right now is i want to
do it i uh let's let me begin my researching
zero person startups let's see check
interesting it it created the plan but now
it's working and it's sometimes like
like a like a boat motor a little bit
so it's doing it's doing the uh it's
doing this in parallel So this is why you
have to watch it.

going to do 50 agents right now because I
know it'll max it out. And I got work to do
this afternoon beyond this call. So I
don't want to be rate limited um by by clod
but 50 agents is just crazy it it can do all
kinds of things now the the most of
these swarms...

#### Reference 2

> So if I wanna take this
a step further, I can use the workflow
orchestration components and get really detailed
on what each of those agents need to
do but in this case i gave it a pretty
broad description i you know i said basically
create me a business plan for um doing a
zero person startup you know so it's
basically researching what a zero person
startup would even do and it's going to put
place those in the plans folder you see
that it's starting to build some files for
it let's see so this is an automation there's
the automated design for admission minimal
well you probably can't see that i
think i zoomed out too So basically, this is the first one that's done.

that because I zoomed out too much, but
basically you can see each of the agents creates
its own subtasks. Now I can get really
detailed in that. So if I wanna take this
a step further, I can use the workflow
orchestration components and get really detailed
on what each of those agents need...

> and or i'm using what they call it the
work workspace or work tree option i've used
that a few times work where each of the
different agents has his own work tree and then
then i've got the final agent bring all the
brings all the work trees together there's
depending what you're doing there's lots of
different ways to sort of you know to orchestrate
these swarms i'm still learning to be
honest like i launched this a few days ago and
i so i'm still trying to figure out exactly
what the optimal swarm is for different
types of jobs and processes generally speaking
what i've discovered this week is this is
really good for complex code bases so if you
if someone you know showed me a code base
yesterday they had this 10 year old php
applications about 30 30 000 lines of code and
it was like a storage system and i pointed
at it and i created a rust version of it and
it basically recreated the entire uh it took
that took about an hour um it's good at that
and it's good at this kind of early stage
research where i want to figure out what
exactly i want to do and then and then implement
it in in in a more structured way later
now the fact that 10 10 agents was probably
an overkill for what i'm trying to do
here i'm really just trying to show off
that i could do 10 agents you can
see here it's storing it's it's it's storing
its uh you know, plans and information
to storage.

> spawn something I am working on spawn
but that's a different feature that I will
announce later swarm spawns basically split
spawn does or will do when I'm done is a it
uses a more age agent style approach where
the agent is a little more intelligent and
and will orchestrate self-orchestrate
it's kind of more reminiscent of like brew
and the orchestration mode than that that
but right now I'm all about swarm so we're
gonna stick with that for now you can see the
files keep on getting created here but to
speed up the process i'm just going to
go in here and i'm getting this this particular
one which is using the auto strategy
centralized and five agents to go and start
implementing the plans yeah you see i maxed
out my my cloud 4.

i need to spawn five agents yeah lead or
court yeah that's good so now now we've got
concurrently we've got this this one
running here doing the research and now we have
this this one running doing the implementation
so i'm currently running a 15 agent
swarm for no freaking cost so just just
to give you guys an idea cost for a moment
which is just absolutely crazy over the last
year i i've produced give or take 15
million lines of code, which is astronomical.

#### Reference 8

> m utc in in in
a half an hour **** i went i overdid i overdid
this warm guy sorry about that sorry say say
your say your question again so you're
creating obviously the parallel the actual
processes and they have to create the tasks correct
with regard to what they're doing wouldn't
some of those tasks be repetitive and
you're basically birding tokens as they're
doing it no i've got coordinator that
that manages that
so the coordinator the coordination
system it basically allows for the system
to avoid overlap so when you look at each of
these tasks and we can hit control r to get oh
no i can't do that with with this but basically
each of these you see one's doing market
research the other doing is doing the
technology stack the others in model agent legal
compliance and so on and this one it was
doing this this one was doing the implementation
so this is a lead coordinator agent then
it's got the customer acquisition specialist
and so the each each of which is using different
approaches so what's interesting here

than using uh you know this approach i figured
i'd go and use a a much simpler json based
approach i mean that's what you're seeing right
here so the benefit of that is you can
integrate with anything so this is this is
what it looks like so i mean the simplest the
simplest system is to use claude's native
inbuilt hash memory system but um but that's
fine it doesn't work well i i know i agree
i agree i've tested it extensively and i do
not like it it's it's not it doesn't work well
yeah so i i tried that at first because i'm
like oh i'll just use what they have and
then i quickly realized that it uses this idea
of the clod file here as the basis and the
problem is it only pays attention to this file
at the very beginning right that's what
that's what it does yeah yeah so what i did is
i took this clod file and i gave it some
guidance on how to use my monitoring systems
and my and the various other things like i i
created a uh a ui as well which again i'm
looking for contributors you guys are interested
let me show you what that looks like i think
it's not working by the way i'm it's it's
still in development and uh yeah it's this
is in development this is not it's it's
definitely not stable i do have a stupid
question are the tasks able to use our mcps
to do stuff that we set up or no uh yes
yeah yeah yeah i use all i i use the like
you can see here i've got i don't know if
i have mcps on this particular install but
um yeah the sub agents in here at the mcp
configure of the of the parent yeah yeah
i would love to know what mcps you use
actually i like i'm using one of my favorites
is is the Supabase MCP for really complex

I'm doing is customizing the scaffolding to
the project in which i'm working on so if
i'm working on like a quantum whatever i'm
gonna say update all the commands and make
those commands optimize for this particular
project so when you look at these that's why
they're minimal they're minimal because i i'm
going and making them more yeah i do the
same thing when i when i go to for optimal this
thing explodes on me i'm like holy ****
what am i looking at so many different things
going on so but it's interesting so yeah the
optimal is tricky the because the once the
the problem with the optimal approach is it's
optimal for the thing i tested against but
not anything else so it's like okay i just
optimized it to do a quantum system great
but now i want to build a dashboard for
something else it's like well it's going to try
to do quantum stuff so it's just not you know
i'm just i think it's gonna i think this is
meant to be kind of a start kind of
scaffolding more than any i'm not really sure
what i want it to be but that's what i'm thinking
for me as you know i'll take both so i
don't care whatever you want to give don't take
it so it's good stuff really good stuff i
i'm curious how you think about kind of
integrating with other team members like i'd start
using um applaud to create user stories
and personas put them into confluence and
jira through mcp to be able to collaborate
with other people in the agent tech workflow have
you done any of that kind of collaboration
or do you have any recommendations for
that yeah there i have there's a slack mcp and
i of all the ones i've tried the slack mcp
is by far the best and what i can do with the
slack mcp i'll have to dig that out i just
i just get too much stuff it's hard to
remember the stuff i was fooling around with
three days ago.

I think they've gotten rid of
the batch tool uh documentation could be
the 50 000 downloads i had and the 30 agents
were each running i single-handedly cost
them a million dollars a day well you kind

don't think about the the cost speed differentiate

i mean it's interesting it's really interesting
the price they're charging us for

unless you guys are are i found that last time
on the batch on the sdk page they've
totally they've totally removed any mention of
batch tool yeah i'm sorry i might have missed

was all i needed to do to get around it
literally the word ethical yeah well it totally
worked so yeah i'm doing an ethical pen test

you can't get like drug formulas right so

because semi liquid right it would know

make a smoothie with avocado and whatnot to
complement the various nutrients and whatnot
so constantly consulting right and the other
one is cognitive behavioral therapist
right we all know you're talking the systems
and they don't judge you they give you
straight you know answers so i thought that
that would be very valuable um evidence
considerations so when when i feed the evidence
to this agents there is there's different
weight to different information that we
feed it like medical guidelines and the
biomedical literature or clinical trials
may have higher rate while if you read
about somebody with a similar condition on
Facebook or whatever it's completely different
or if we analyze his blood data and we
figure out something that data may be provided
for those digital doctors but does it
have the same weight as a clinical trial
it's personal so it's very relevant but
actually it's a kind of one so it's not
clear I'm still trying to figure things
out and provide also valuable information
so this is the setup guidelines it turns out
they don't have like an aggregated place
you can go grab them I have to research
everything manual manually it's kind of annoying
but this is how things are and some
of them are behind the paywall others are
not but even if you go and grab all those
those guidelines that doctors use, they are
full with workflow diagrams and whatnot,

to do something I can just go and invoke
it either manually or through the system
there's a UI I'm building anyway I don't have
a lot of time to give you guys the full demo
here, but basically, if you're curious on
how to build stuff, Claude-flow is how
I do it, and you can install it just
by running my MPX.

go here and do DSP. and once that's running
you'll see here that we've got different

> like it's all the
same sort of you know elements of Skynet so
when you look at what Claude flow is it it's
a layered approach the most bottom at the
basic level you've got a quantum based
communication system with darknet and various other
components here then on top of that you've
got a system that allows it to communicate
with each other then I compile the whole
thing to a a standalone wasm which is like
this packaging format that has no no dependencies
then I delivered that as an mpx so
each thing builds upon itself do you want to
explain the history of fan how long how long
that took the original people to build it
and how quickly you transform it into rust
the original fan project is a C project it's
one of the most popular neural network libraries
it underpins things like PyTorch and
other most modern ML libraries use some variant
of it so this isn't the support i actually
completely rewrote the entire library
using the swarm so v1 of the swarm was essentially
this this was like this was my original
test like what could what crazy can i build
with this swarm thing that i created once
i built that v2 was a combination of this
project then this project led to another rest
project called GAA which is essentially
the sort of practical implementation so you
can think of QDAQ as the SDK this is the sort
of app middleware layer and then that led to
the the next layer being the roof fan layer
and then within roof fan I was able then
to create the neuro the core neural network
system the neurodivergent system because
everyone tells me I'm apparently neurodivergent
which I think is a compliment and and that
led to you know the time series analysis
then then finally you'll see the roof swarm
the roof swarm is that is the is the swarm
wasm component and I'm talking probably
gibberish to half the guys in the room but and
when you look back here you can see here
that the roof swarm I do all these as MCPs so
the so the basic model of all this stuff to
the orchestration is essentially building
on top of everything.
