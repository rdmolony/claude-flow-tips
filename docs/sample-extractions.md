## Security Warnings (GOTCHAS)

### GOTCHA: Dangerous Permissions Security Risk

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Running Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` locally outside a sandbox can compromise your machine and access credentials.

<details>
<summary>üìù Source Quote</summary>

> "the dangerously skipped permission is a security vulnerability. Yes, a hundred percent it is. You're having an autonomous AI swarm, you know, operating with very little oversight. And so this is why I'm using a code space. It's important. Don't run this locally. If you do, it's just a bad idea. You're on Mac, high likelihood it breaks your Mac badly and you get a kernel panic and you're going to have to reinstall the entire Mac."

**Source**: `en-AI Hacker League July 10_ Mastering Autonomous Agents with CloudFlow and Swarm Technology.txt`, lines 284-294
</details>

**Key Points**:
- Use GitHub Codespaces or Docker containers for safety
- Local execution can cause kernel panics on Mac
- Autonomous AI swarms have "very little oversight"
- Windows users with Linux subsystem have "a little bit more protection"

## Productivity Tips (TIPS)

### TIP: Use Bash Aliases for Long Commands

**üí° TIP**: Create bash aliases for frequently used long Claude Code commands to improve workflow efficiency.

<details>
<summary>üìù Source Quote</summary>

> "when you're in cloud code, often you have to type out a long-winded sort of description. What I've been using are aliases... So when I type in DSP, what's happening, so dangerously skip permissions, it jumps and does the entire command. And I can also do things... like dangerously skip permissions dash C. And these are bash aliases that allow me, and with the dash C, it allows me to continue where I left off."

**Source**: `en-AI Hackerspace August 1st_ From CLI Aliases to Neural Networks - Advancing AI Engineering.txt`, lines 86-98
</details>

**Implementation**:
- Create aliases in `.bashrc` for common commands
- Use continuation flags (like `-C`) to resume previous work
- Examples: `DSP` for "dangerously skip permissions"

### TIP: Better Specifications Lead to Better Results

**üí° TIP**: Write detailed specifications (300-400 words) and ask Claude to clarify unclear points before implementation.

<details>
<summary>üìù Source Quote</summary>

> "the thing that's helped me accelerate quickly to getting it running for three or four hours without interruption has been to define in about three or 400 words, the application or the thing I want to build, and then ask it to list 10 things that are unclear or need to be improved and keep iterating until I'm satisfied that the next 10 things are irrelevant to the application. And then ultimately, that ends up with maybe a, I don't know, 300, 400 line markdown file outlining the project along with supplemental documentation. And that seems to be enough to get to the point where I can walk away comfortably and come back to a prototype"

**Source**: `en-Agentics Live Vibe Coding - June 19, 2025.txt`, lines 1435-1446
</details>

**Best Practice**:
- Define application in 300-400 words
- Ask Claude to list 10 unclear things
- Keep iterating until next 10 things are irrelevant
- Results in 300-400 line markdown file with project outline
- Enables walking away and returning to working prototype

### TIP: Use Slack MCP for Bi-directional Swarm Communication

**üí° TIP**: Implement Slack MCP to enable real-time communication with running swarms without waiting for completion.

<details>
<summary>üìù Source Quote</summary>

> "the Slack MCP allows for a sort of bi-directional communication with the system. So not only can I get the Swarm to sort of update the Slack, I can then respond to the messages sent in Slack that get sent back to the Swarm. And I have a secondary means of communicating with the Swarm itself... by adding the slack mcp i've got the ability to embed communications directly"

**Source**: `en-Agentics Live Vibe Coding - June 19, 2025.txt`, lines 1034-1049
</details>
