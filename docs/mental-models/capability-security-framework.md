# Mental Model: Capability-Based Security Framework

## Mental Model: Agent-Safe by Design
### Key Insight:
Security in multi-agent systems should be built at the architecture level using capability tokens rather than traditional access control. Think of it as giving each agent a non-fungible token that represents their specific capabilities and access rights.

### Application:
- Grant each agent specific capability tokens rather than broad permissions
- Use token-based authorization for resource access
- Design systems where security is inherent in the architecture
- Implement fine-grained access control at the agent level

## Mental Model: Non-Fungible Capability Tokens  
### Key Insight:
Instead of traditional role-based access control, use non-fungible tokens to represent each agent's unique capabilities and resource access rights. This creates a more granular and secure permission system.

### Application:
- Issue unique capability tokens to each agent
- Define specific resource access through token properties  
- Enable dynamic capability granting and revocation
- Create audit trails through token transactions
- Build marketplaces for capability trading between agents
