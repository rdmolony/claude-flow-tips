# Mental Model: AI-Human Interface

## Mental Model: AI as Cognitive Prosthetic
### Key Insight:
Think of AI systems not as replacement tools, but as prosthetic extensions for human cognition - allowing us to interact with and understand things beyond our natural cognitive capabilities.

### Application:
- Design AI interfaces that augment rather than replace human thinking
- Build systems that extend human cognitive reach into complex domains
- Create seamless integration between human intuition and AI analysis
- Develop AI that enhances human decision-making rather than making decisions independently
- Focus on human-AI collaboration rather than human-AI competition

## Mental Model: Universal Translator for Complexity
### Key Insight:
AI can serve as a "universal translator" for complex systems - helping humans understand and interact with complicated domains that would normally take decades or centuries to comprehend.

### Application:
- Use AI to translate complex technical concepts into understandable insights
- Build interfaces that make complicated systems accessible to non-experts
- Create AI systems that can bridge different domains of knowledge
- Design tools that accelerate human learning and understanding of complex topics
- Implement AI-assisted exploration of unknown or poorly understood domains
