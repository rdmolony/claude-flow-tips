# Mental Model: Agent Coordination Topologies

## Mental Model: Brain Adaptation Analogy
### Key Insight:
AI agents should be designed with adaptive, fault-tolerant connections like synapses in the human brain. Just as the brain can reorganize itself after injury and maintain functionality, distributed agent systems should be resilient and adaptable.

### Application:
- Build agent networks that can lose individual components without system failure
- Design adaptive communication pathways between agents
- Implement self-healing and reorganization capabilities
- Create modular systems where agents can join/leave dynamically

> "And I like the idea of synapses in terms of like the human brain, because the synapse in your brain are adaptive. And if you look at like, you know, brain injuries, as an example, if you have a traumatic brain injury that your brain has is malleable, it can adjust to a certain degree based on these types of sort of things that happen. You can lose a portion of your brain and still, you know, functionally operate, hopefully."

## Mental Model: Distributed Neural System Architecture
### Key Insight:
Instead of traditional monolithic models or simple mixtures of experts, think of agent systems as distributed neural networks where each agent acts as a synaptic element within a broader neural architecture.

### Application:
- Design agents as specialized synaptic nodes in a larger network
- Mix and match different neural architectures (forward-looking, attention-based)
- Enable modular, focused agents that run independently
- Build systems that can scale globally with thousands/millions of agents

## Mental Model: Micro Neural Network Architecture
### Key Insight:
The future of neural networks is not bigger monolithic models, but globally distributed micro neural networks - small, transient, ephemeral models built just-in-time for specific tasks.

### Application:
- Deploy sub-1-million parameter models for specific tasks
- Build transient, ephemeral models that are created and destroyed as needed
- Enable CPU-based inference without GPU requirements
- Create specialized models for trading, medical devices, robotics, etc.
