# Mental Model: Swarm Intelligence

## Mental Model: Distributed Neural Networks
### Key Insight:
Instead of having monolithic AI models, we can create thousands or millions of small, specialized agents that collaborate collectively. This is analogous to how synapses work in the human brain - individual neurons are simple, but collectively they create intelligence.

### Application:
- Deploy multiple small (10,000 parameter) models instead of one large model
- Each agent specializes in specific tasks (trading, medical, robotics)
- Agents can run on CPU rather than requiring GPU resources
- Global distribution allows for resilient, scalable AI systems

> "But this allows us to take that idea and spread it globally. So now rather than having a single language model or single model, you have groups of thousands or millions of these agents that are collectively pooling their resources to solve problems in a sort of purposeful way. So the analogy of synapses is a kind of really important part of this."

## Mental Model: Hive Mind Concept  
### Key Insight:
The evolution from individual AI tools to collective AI intelligence represents a fundamental shift in how we think about artificial intelligence - moving from isolated systems to interconnected, collaborative networks.

### Application:
- Design AI systems that share knowledge and capabilities
- Build networks of specialized agents rather than generalist systems
- Focus on emergent behaviors from collective intelligence
- Enable autonomous coordination between AI systems
