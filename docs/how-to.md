## Setup and Configuration

### How to Setup GitHub-Swarm Bi-directional Sync
Establish 2-way synchronization between your agent swarm and GitHub repositories for continuous integration.

**Steps:**
1. *[To be populated from transcript analysis]*
2. *[Waiting for semantic extraction to complete]*
3. *[Steps will be extracted from community discussions]*

**Why this matters:** Enables continuous integration and keeps your swarm synchronized with repository changes.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Agent Management

### How to Initialize a Swarm Topology
Set up the appropriate swarm topology based on your project requirements.

**Steps:**
1. Choose topology type (mesh, hierarchical, ring, star)
2. Initialize with `claude-flow swarm init --topology [type]`
3. Configure agent roles and capabilities
4. Test coordination before production use

**Why this matters:** Proper topology selection affects performance and coordination efficiency.

### How to Spawn and Coordinate Multiple Agents
Create multiple specialized agents that work together on complex tasks.

**Steps:**
1. Define agent roles and responsibilities
2. Use batchtool for parallel agent creation
3. Establish communication protocols
4. Monitor coordination and performance

**Why this matters:** Parallel agent execution improves development speed and task completion.

**Confidence:** High

## Integration Workflows

### How to Set up Safe Development Environment
Configure a secure environment for Claude Flow development.

**Steps:**
1. Use Docker containers or cloud environments (GitHub Codespaces)
2. Never run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` locally
3. Set up appropriate access controls
4. Configure backup and recovery procedures

**Why this matters:** Prevents security breaches and system damage from AI agent actions.

**Confidence:** High
