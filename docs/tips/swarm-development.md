# Swarm Development and AI Engineering Tips

## Swarm Architecture Principles

### Tip: Start with Specifications, Not Implementation

Always begin with proper planning and system design.

### Tip: Focus and Targeting Improve Performance

Narrow, specialized systems work better than broad ones.

> "the more targeted and the more focused that these applications and these agentic systems are, the better they work. And often when you start, you'll start with a kind of vibe session where you're like, build me an interplanetary communication system. Sure. But what does that actually mean? And the key is to build big, complicated things requires many smaller targeted things to sort of be assembled."

### Tip: Modularity is Key to Complex Systems

Build systems with modular components.

### Tip: Use Lego Building Block Approach

Think in terms of composable, reusable components.

## Implementation Strategies

### Tip: Use Modular Approach with Existing Components

Leverage previously built components for efficiency.

### Tip: Parallel Development Approach

Utilize concurrent development for better efficiency.

### Tip: Understand Different Approaches - Swarm vs Hive Mind

Choose the right approach for your use case.

## Consensus and Coordination

### Tip: Understand Consensus System Options

Different consensus mechanisms for different needs.

### Tip: Majority Rules vs Weighted Approaches

Choose appropriate decision-making mechanisms.

### Tip: System Optimization Based on Task Requirements

Let the system determine the best approach for each task.

## Specialized Development Approaches

### Tip: Different Specializations for Different Tasks

Create specialized scraping and analysis systems.

## System Design Philosophy

### Tip: Method to the Madness - Structured Approach

Have clear structure even in complex systems.

### Tip: Declarative Approach for Agent Operation

Let agents determine their own operation methods.
