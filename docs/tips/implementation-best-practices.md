</details>

### Tip: Let Swarms Operate with Minimal Constraints

Better performance when systems have more freedom.

## Process Optimization

### Tip: Understanding Processes Helps Find Mistakes

Process visibility enables error detection.

</details>

### Tip: Align with Process but Watch for Deviations

Monitor for systems that appear aligned but aren't.

## Technical Implementation

### Tip: Processing vs Reasoning in Code

Understand the difference between deterministic and intelligent systems.
