Um, again, Cloud Code, cause I, that's my current, uh, obsession. Um, so let, let me show you a few things. So I don't know if any of you guys have noticed. Let me get a second to get this going. I know it takes a second to share my screen. But when you're in cloud code, often you have to type out a long-winded sort of description. What I've been using are aliases."

> "So when I type in DSP, what's happening, so dangerously skip permissions, it jumps and does the entire command. And I can also do things, I don't know if I actually did this here, but I can also do things like dangerously skip permissions dash C. And these are bash aliases that allow me, and with the dash C, it allows me to continue where I left off."
