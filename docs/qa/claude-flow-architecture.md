# Claude Flow Architecture Q&A

## Q: How do you want people to think about the product? Do you want them to really think about it from the top layer, Claude Flow?

**A:** So it's a great question. And when you look at Rube Swarm, and I know I named it after myself, but whatever, this is an SDK. So every one of these components are connected via MCP. So everything I'm building is interoperable with whatever we were going to build in the future through a kind of unified MCP interface. So you can think of these systems as a combination of SDK, sort of a software development environment that allows you to plug in and build other things.

> "quick question for you rUv uh the the slide set the slide you had before that showed the beautiful stack uh eight i think it is it shows um uh back uh oh that one Yeah, right. So you got Claude Flow at the top here and all these other pieces. When people hang out in the Agentix Foundation, you'll hear people talk about Fan and Swarm and neurodiversity and DAA and QDAG. But how do you want people to think about the product? Do you want them to really think about it from the top layer, Claude Flow? Because other people that are more technical are going to be talking about Roof Swarm and Roof Fan and QDAG. How do you really want people to think about it? So it's a great question. And when you look at Rube Swarm, and I know I named it after myself, but whatever, this is an SDK."

## Q: Are you testing quantum entanglement? You are running this on your CPU. How do we make it easily intelligible to someone who thinking like you need quantum computers to do that?

**A:** So that's a really good question. I would use the Azure or AWS quantum computer because it's cheap and accessible to actually start doing the physical testing beyond this. So right now I'm simulating. I would start with a simulation. Once the simulation sort of passes, you've got a pretty good chance that it'll work effectively.

## Q: What is the prompt that you actually used? Can you show us the human English conversational prompt that you wrote?

**A:** I'm going to have to write it again, David, because I don't have the prompt anymore or the history. But Brad I remember you mentioning sometime in the past an attempt to define hello world - this may be it especially because I believe it's accessible to the claude pro plan not just max and that becomes a benchmark that you can test all kinds of different frameworks against.

> "a question could you sorry someone else had a question yeah i just as it brings to mind we need a prompt log like a full log of exactly the prompts that you used That's my question. Is it? Hold on. That was my question. I was like, I would love to see the prompt. I think it won't. That is the secret sauce question, right? When someone says I did this, really, everybody wants to ask that question. So I'm just putting it out there. It's like, what is the prompt that you actually, can you just bring it up in a text editor and show us that prompt? What is it that you actually, the human English conversational prompt that you wrote? I'm going to have to write it again, David, because I don't have the prompt anymore or the history."
