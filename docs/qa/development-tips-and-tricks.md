# Development Tips and Tricks Q&A

## Q: How can you efficiently handle long-winded descriptions in Cloud Code?

**A:** What I've been using are aliases. So when you're in cloud code, often you have to type out a long-winded sort of description. These are bash aliases that allow me to create shortcuts. For example, when I type in DSP (dangerously skip permissions), it jumps and does the entire command. And with the dash C, it allows me to continue where I left off.

And for those that tuned in yesterday, it's a repeat, but whatever. So when I type in DSP, what's happening, so dangerously skip permissions, it jumps and does the entire command. And I can also do things, I don't know if I actually did this here, but I can also do things like dangerously skip permissions dash C. And these are bash aliases that allow me, and with the dash C, it allows me to continue where I left off."

## Q: How do you create bash aliases for Cloud Code commands?

**A:** In Cloud Code, what you need to do is say, create an alias in bash rc for the following command. You can use this for any command, but in this case, you're going to go and you're going to say something like "dangerously skip permissions." You could use it for all kinds of things. Like if you want to stream the output, you can do that as well.

So, in clod, what you need to do is say, create an alias in bash rc for the following command. And for that, what we'll do is I'm just going to grab this quickly, and I'm going to just say clod And you can use this again for any command, but in this case, you're going to go and you're going to say something like dangerously skip permissions. So in this case, and you could use it for all kinds of things. Like if you want to stream the output, you can do that as well."
