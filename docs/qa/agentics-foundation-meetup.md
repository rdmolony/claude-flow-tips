# Agentics Foundation London Chapter Q&A

## Q: What is the maturity level and what do we want out of this goal?

**A:** The intent here is for us to get to know each other better at the London level. We'll start with kind of a series of questions to determine the maturity level of what we want out of this goal, and then effectively get some feedback loop at the end of the hour to say what value we have gained from this session and in the future.

> "Given that this is our first session, so thank you all for making the time today. I think we are being streamed on LinkedIn and YouTube. I think Ben has kindly set that up, but just for information. And the intent here is for us to get to know each other better, I guess, at this level, at the London level. And because I'm not sure, I can see, I mean, almost all of you probably, I saw Armand and Connor and Jim, Marcus, Max, Peter, So we may have met, so apologies if I am unable to, because I'm not able to see everyone. So there is, I just thought that we'll start with kind of a series of questions to say, like, what is the maturity level of what do we want out of this goal? And then effectively get some feedback loop at the end of the hour or 56 minutes now to say what value we have gone from this session and in the future."
