# AGI and Consensus Building Q&A

## Q: What is AGI and why do we need consensus?

**A:** I don't know what AGI is. I don't think there's a clear definition yet. But the question of consensus is critical because how do you build consensus? There may be different perspectives and approaches, and we need mechanisms to bring people together on these important decisions.

## Q: How do you get those proofs and distinguish the body of knowledge?

**A:** That's a challenging question. How do you distinguish the body of knowledge from speculation or incomplete understanding? We need better frameworks for evaluating and validating what we claim to know, especially in rapidly evolving fields like AI.

## Q: What is the timeline and what is the risk?

**A:** Even if people agree on the direction, what is the timeline? What is the risk? Like, even in the best case scenarios, we need to understand the temporal aspects and risk factors involved in AI development and deployment.
