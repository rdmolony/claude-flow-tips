# Claude Flow UI Development Q&A

## Q: What kind of web dashboard are you building for Claude Flow?

**A:** This is basically a UI for the front end of Claude Flow and I did it as retro as I possibly could. It's a dashboard I guess - I'm using a combination of components here, I'm using web sockets to connect to the back end MCP. It's a super retro interface that allows me to sort of get a feel for how it's going to run and how it's going to operate.

## Q: What features does the Claude Flow dashboard include?

**A:** There's this sort of initial dashboard components. You can see the swarm - I can add my various swarm elements so I can choose and we can spawn a swarm. I can choose different options like an architect or tester coordinator code or whatever. I can add tasks, and that will show up in the task flow. And we got various memory components. This is basically just showing how it's storing the various memories for what's interacting with it. The other part I have here is the MCP integration.

I'm not sure. I'm still building it just as an FYI. I guess my dragging component doesn't quite work right. I can add tasks, test, submit that. And that will show up here in the task flow. And we got my various memory components. This is basically just showing it how it's storing the various memories for what's interacting with it. Lots of information here. This is raw. I probably got to do a better job of cleaning it up, but I'll start raw. The other part I have here is the MPX integration."
