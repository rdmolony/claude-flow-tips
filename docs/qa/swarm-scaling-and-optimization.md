# Swarm Scaling and Optimization Q&A

## Q: How do you decide on how many agents or how many unique agents you want to have going in a swarm?

**A:** You kind of go for fives like fives, five or 50. I put in five and seen what happened. I did of course try more - it crashed badly. It got to about 150 and everything sort of stopped. But so it did attempt. I think I know how to do 5,000. I would have to have multiple $200 Claude Max accounts. And then I'd use Tmux and create multiple instances, probably a VS Code Swarm, and then I'd orchestrate all of them.

## Q: How do you become an ambassador for the organization?

**A:** You fill out the form and then we'll have a chance to meet - we'll get on a zoom call, get a sense of your background, if you've done any event management before, what your thoughts are, and then if everything looks like it's in sync you hold your first event and if that all goes well, everybody's thrilled and happy, then there's a chapter formation and then it's off and running.

## Q: Why choose five agents instead of 10 or 20?

**A:** Five seems like all my systems can handle without crashing. The reason I did five and not 10 or 20 is that five appears to be the sweet spot for stability and performance in my current setup. Going beyond that requires more complex orchestration and infrastructure.
