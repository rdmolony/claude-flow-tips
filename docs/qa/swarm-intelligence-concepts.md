# Swarm Intelligence and Concepts Q&A

## Q: How is the swarm making decisions? How is it coming to consensus on those decisions?

**A:** I think there's probably a couple of different things happening here. The key part of that was how do you secure that and how do you provide a kind of consensus mechanism and how do you build these kind of autonomous applications or companies based on this technology. When we look at the DAA as an example, this is a distributed autonomous system dedicated to creating quantum resistance, economic self-sustainability.

So I'm, what I'm trying to do is illustrate the art of the possible wherever I can."

## Q: How does the system avoid bias in swarm decision-making?

**A:** Yeah, because what's happening is that each agent is trained on different data sets and different perspectives. So when they come together in a swarm, they're bringing different viewpoints and approaches to the problem, which helps reduce individual bias through collective intelligence.

## Q: Is this just security-focused or broader in scope?

**A:** So this one is much broader than just security. We're looking at building autonomous systems that can handle economic self-sustainability, quantum resistance, and distributed decision-making. The security aspect is just one component of a much larger vision for autonomous organizations and applications.
