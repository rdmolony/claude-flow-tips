# ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Pitfalls and Common Mistakes

This document contains development pitfalls, common mistakes, and gotchas extracted from AI development transcripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Crashes and Failures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Swarm Resource Exhaustion
**Warning**: Running too many concurrent agents can crash your development environment.

<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "My swarm just crashed my instance. So this happens. Oh, it looks like it finished anyway. But here, this is how you recover from a crashed instance, if you guys are running too many VS codes."

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:522-526
</details>

**Impact**: System crashes can lose work and interrupt development flow.

**Mitigation**: 
- Monitor resource usage when running multiple agents
- Switch from swarm to sequential implementation for resource-constrained environments
- Use appropriate hardware/cloud instances with sufficient RAM

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Sequential vs Parallel Implementation Trade-offs
**Warning**: Need to choose between swarm-based and sequential implementation based on resource constraints.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "I probably need to switch at this point from a swarm based implementation to a sequential implementation. So there's two issues I have. I'm probably just using a code space that doesn't have enough RAM, most likely."

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:533-536
</details>

**Impact**: Poor implementation choice leads to crashes and development bottlenecks.

**Mitigation**: 
- Assess available resources before choosing implementation strategy
- Have fallback sequential modes for resource-constrained scenarios
- Monitor memory usage and adjust concurrency accordingly

## üíª API and Error Handling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: API Error Propagation
**Warning**: API errors can cascade through swarm systems unpredictably.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "i've i had an api error i need to to implement so let's let's go ahead and let's do that"

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:311-312
</details>

**Impact**: Single API failures can break entire swarm operations.

**Mitigation**: 
- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Design systems to gracefully degrade when APIs fail
- Use circuit breakers for external API dependencies

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Dangerously Skip Permissions Requirement
**Warning**: Systems may require explicit permission bypassing for functionality.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "help you need to go here and run the dangerously allow if you don't do that you're going to get an error and i just i probably can figure out a way to get to to make that error not happen"

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:289-293
</details>

**Impact**: Users get confused by permission errors and may abandon setup.

**Mitigation**: 
- Provide clear documentation about permission requirements
- Implement graceful permission request flows
- Consider UX alternatives to "dangerously skip" patterns

## üéØ Testing and Validation Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: SWE-Bench Perfect Scores Can Be Misleading
**Warning**: 100% completion rates may not reflect real-world performance.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "i by the way i got 100 on that swe bench i didn't fail once so it's and and then what i did is i said how many of these can i do concurrently"

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:614-616
</details>

**Impact**: Over-confidence in benchmarks may lead to production issues.

**Mitigation**: 
- Test on diverse, real-world scenarios beyond benchmarks
- Implement gradual rollout strategies
- Monitor performance in production environments

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Concurrent Execution Limits
**Warning**: Systems have practical concurrency limits that must be discovered through testing.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "what i did is i said how many of these can i do concurrently and then i just kicked it off five at a time and it the systems do seem to like fives"

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:616-621
</details>

**Impact**: Exceeding concurrency limits leads to system failures and crashes.

**Mitigation**: 
- Test concurrency limits systematically
- Implement dynamic scaling based on resource availability
- Use backpressure mechanisms to prevent overload

---

## üîß Development Environment Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Screen Sharing and Demo Failures
**Warning**: Live demos often fail due to screen sharing and technical issues.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "Oh, I'm sharing the wrong screen. Let me try to find the right one from here."

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live - June 20_ Swarm Development, AI Security, and Finland's AGI Preparation.txt:903-904
</details>

**Impact**: Technical difficulties during presentations can undermine credibility.

**Mitigation**: 
- Test screen sharing setup before presentations
- Have backup demo materials ready
- Practice demo scenarios multiple times

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Token Counting and Conversion Issues
**Warning**: LLMs have mechanical issues with token conversion that affect accuracy.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "You should be aware that when the LLMs break up the documents into tokens, as they put them into the transformers, as they split a concept up, you will not get the correct thing."

> Source: en-Toronto Chapter 2025-08-12_18-49-45 .txt:1969-1973
</details>

**Impact**: Token conversion issues lead to incorrect processing and results.

**Mitigation**: 
- Understand tokenization limitations of your chosen models
- Design prompts to work within token boundaries
- Test with edge cases involving token splits

## üåê Data Access and Accessibility Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Scientific Research Accessibility Gap
**Warning**: AI models may lack access to specialized scientific research.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "A lot of time, it's very hard for the public to have access to it. So they're probably training models on more of the web, like data. Your stuff is probably harder to find, like, how many people get access to read your"

> Source: en-Toronto Chapter 2025-08-12_18-49-45 .txt:1190-1193
</details>

**Impact**: AI systems may lack domain-specific knowledge due to training data gaps.

**Mitigation**: 
- Supplement AI with domain-specific knowledge bases
- Provide access to specialized research databases
- Implement expert review systems for specialized domains

## üîÑ Process and Workflow Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Result Validation Necessity
**Warning**: AI-generated results require human validation and review.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "So you have to review your results. Don't assume they're all right."

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live July 11_ The Rise of Swarm Intelligence and Autonomous Agents.txt:1301
</details>

**Impact**: Unvalidated AI results can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

**Mitigation**: 
- Implement systematic result validation processes
- Use multiple validation approaches (human, automated, cross-validation)
- Build review checkpoints into AI workflows

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Planning Before Implementation
**Warning**: Starting development without proper planning leads to issues.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "when building these things you never want to start specifically you want to start you want to create a plan right you want to"

> Source: en-AI Hackerspace Live July 11_ The Rise of Swarm Intelligence and Autonomous Agents.txt:141-143
</details>

**Impact**: Lack of planning leads to architectural problems and rework.

**Mitigation**: 
- Always start with clear specifications and requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Context Window Limitations
**Warning**: Large context windows may not provide expected improvements.

<details>
<summary>Source Quote</summary>

> "even though it has issues with it today, the GPT-5 today"

> Source: en-Toronto Chapter 2025-08-12_18-49-45 .txt:526
</details>

**Impact**: Current AI models still have fundamental limitations despite improvements.

**Mitigation**: 
- Design around known AI limitations
