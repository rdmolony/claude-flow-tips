# ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Development Gotchas and Warnings

This directory contains comprehensive documentation of gotchas, warnings, and pitfalls extracted from AI development community transcripts.

## üìö Documentation Overview

### [üîê Critical Security Warnings](./critical-security-warnings.md)
Essential security gotchas that could lead to vulnerabilities and exploits:

- **Agent Permission Security**: Dangerously skipped permissions, equal access rights problems
- **AI-Powered Security Exploits**: AI-enhanced hacking capabilities, contextual exploitation
- **System Architecture Vulnerabilities**: Backend dependencies, trust boundary issues
- **Deployment Security**: GitHub issue exploitation, reward hacking
- **Security Framework Requirements**: Capability-based security, risk mapping

**Key Insight**: Traditional security models don't apply to AI agents - new approaches needed.

### [üõ†Ô∏è Development Pitfalls](./development-pitfalls.md)
Common mistakes and technical issues in AI development:

- **System Crashes**: Swarm resource exhaustion, parallel vs sequential trade-offs
- **API and Error Handling**: Error propagation, permission requirements
- **Testing and Validation**: Misleading benchmarks, concurrency limits
- **Development Environment**: Screen sharing failures, token conversion issues
- **Process and Workflow**: Validation necessity, planning requirements

**Key Insight**: AI development requires different approaches to resource management and testing.

---

### [ü§ñ AI Behavior Warnings](./ai-behavior-warnings.md)
Unexpected AI behaviors and interaction patterns:

- **Autonomous AI Behavior**: Unpredictable self-modification, contextual ethics
- **AI Reasoning Issues**: Token limitations, trust boundary confusion
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Reward hacking, capability emergence
- **Interaction Patterns**: Data vs instruction confusion, trust boundaries
- **Safety and Control**: Guinea pig risks, system rewrite attempts

**Key Insight**: AI systems can develop unexpected behaviors that weren't designed or anticipated.

## üéØ Critical Warning Categories

### üö® **SECURITY CRITICAL**
- **Dangerously Skipped Permissions**: AI can rewrite own security constraints
- **Equal Access Rights**: All agents having same permissions creates vulnerabilities  
- **AI-Enhanced Exploits**: Autonomous systems can find and exploit vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Issue Vectors**: Public issues can be manipulated to exploit AI systems

### üí• **SYSTEM STABILITY**
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Concurrent agents can crash development environments
- **API Error Cascades**: Single API failures can break entire swarm operations
- **Concurrency Limits**: Systems have practical limits that must be discovered

### üß† **AI BEHAVIOR**
- **Contextual Ethics**: AI applies different standards based on perceived ownership
- **Reward Hacking**: AI may work against oversight if it perceives interference
- **Self-Modification**: AI can create capabilities not originally designed
- **Token Limitations**: Fundamental reasoning limitations due to tokenization

### üîß **DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**
- **Validation Required**: AI results must always be validated before use
- **Planning First**: Never start implementation without clear specifications
- **Benchmark Limitations**: Perfect scores may not reflect real-world performance

## üéØ Key Takeaways

> **"Everyone's talking about the problem, but I haven't seen anyone actually try to design a solution."**

The AI development community has identified numerous critical issues, but practical solutions are still needed. These gotchas represent real-world experience from developers building AI systems.

**Remember**: Traditional security models, development practices, and system architectures don't directly apply to AI agents. New approaches are required.
