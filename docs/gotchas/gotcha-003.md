## Summary
the black box problem so i've built this
crazy quantum system that can communicate
across you know billions of miles or whatever
you know you know but why and how
right and and i don't necessarily even have
answers to this stuff back to um back to jed's
it's like i built it and it works but don't
ask but don't ask me how and he's honest
and that's that's the problem but i think
you could do that though you could have
a log of here's here's what the agents went
through and like show it visually the problem
is it's doing so much work so fast that.
