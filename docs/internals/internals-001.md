## Summary
I'm like,
has anyone ever thought to create a
virtual machine for a quantum environment.

## Details
$500 and you can last So what I wanted
to do was create a mechanism to segment
the quantum computing system so I could
run multiple jobs at the same time
and using the same resource. I'm like,
has anyone ever thought to create a
virtual machine for a quantum environment?
Apparently not. So I buy myself a
quantum virtual machine. So anyone who says you
can't build complex stuff, just point
into this and you see all kinds of crazy
stuff. You know, so the other project I did
the other day was a carbon matrix constant
attention mechanism system, so inside of
neural network, I created a basic matrix system
to optimize the internal workings of
