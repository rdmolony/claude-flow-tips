## Summary
I'm like, has anyone ever thought
to create a virtual machine for a
quantum environment.

## Details
that really fast. So what I wanted to do
was create a mechanism to segment the quantum
computing system so I can run multiple
jobs at the same time using the same
resource. I'm like, has anyone ever thought
to create a virtual machine for a
quantum environment? Apparently not. So I buy myself a
quantum virtual machine. So anyone that says
you can't build complex stuff, just
point them to this, and you can see all
kinds of crazy stuff. So the other project
I did the other day It was a Karten
matrix contained attention mechanism
system. So inside of neural network, I
created basically a matrix system to
optimize the internal workings of a... Anyway,
