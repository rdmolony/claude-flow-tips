## Summary
And that AB run says essentially like, I
know I need to change, but before I change,
I need to know where I'm at and what
I'm competing against.

## Details

on purpose, like purposeful drift that
we're going to create. And then when that
mechanism occurs, it's ******* off an AB run.
And that AB run says essentially like, I
know I need to change, but before I change,
I need to know where I'm at and what
