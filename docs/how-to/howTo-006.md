## Summary
so so basically in
when we were doing in drew code i would in
my prom specifically say that use for
example test driven development approach
london school write test before you develop
anything you know follow that methodology so
you don't have it would write all the
test cases first feature by feature and then
build now when i use for example swarm or
hive mind I generally have a PRD and I
ask it, here is the PRD, here are all the
specs, now build it.
