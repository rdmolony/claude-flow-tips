## Summary
Any of us working
on the models from a year ago were
able to get the same results because we
were able to create these kind of
recursions using GT4.

## Details
-depth thought processes, way worse
hallucinations. But is it
fundamentally more capable than it
was a year ago? No. Any of us working

has tools to go answer that when it experiences
an error. And if you do it long

do that since GPT-4. Now, the problem
is, we're fixated on this
idea of these gaming, or gamed leaderboard stats
