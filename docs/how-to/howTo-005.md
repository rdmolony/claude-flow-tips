## Summary
trying to make mock uh or simulations to try
to fake results i don't know why i keep first
i keep pushing back i keep pushing back
like you are you gotta mock it before you
create it that's my spark methodology if if
you're trying to build before you know what
you're building it's going to fail and go down
a rabbit hole of just constant errors so
when you use spark the first step is to create
a pseudo code outline and mocks of of the
structure using a test driven development
approach that means it's working correctly the
part that that you need to watch out for
is after all your mocks are are complete you
need to make sure that the system has gone
from a mock version of it to a functional.
