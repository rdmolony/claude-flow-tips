## Summary
I'd love to have a
workflow where I can just like talk to
Claude, say, go create personas for these 20
different target audiences, then have those go
to some marketing person get approved
by marketing and then once those are approved
come back to Claude and then UI starts
to get generated and the UI goes back
for approval you can definitely do that with
Notion it would create a Notion page that's
shared with a bunch of team members and
it would create a whole bunch however
you want it and then anyone who contributed
outside of Claude in that process, Claude
would see that update okay The way I've been.
