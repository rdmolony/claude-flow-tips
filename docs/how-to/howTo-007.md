## Summary
So it does build
it, it mocks things up and it works,
but I don't see it writing the
test cases per se.

## Details
you don't have it would write all the
test cases first feature by feature and then
build now when i use for example swarm or
hive mind I generally have a PRD and I
ask it, here is the PRD, here are all the
specs, now build it. So it does build
