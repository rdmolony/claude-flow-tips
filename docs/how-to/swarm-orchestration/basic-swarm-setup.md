# How To: Create and Run Your First AI Swarm

## Overview
This guide walks through creating and orchestrating your first AI swarm using Claude Flow, from basic setup to advanced multi-agent coordination.

## Prerequisites
- Claude Flow properly installed and initialized
- Basic understanding of swarm modes and agent types

## Steps

### Step 1: Understanding Swarm Modes
Claude Flow supports several swarm orchestration modes:

- **Auto Mode**: Automatically determines the best approach
- **Centralized**: Central coordination structure  
- **Hierarchical**: Tree-like command structure
- **Distributed**: Decentralized agent communication

### Step 2: Start a Basic Swarm
Begin with auto mode for your first swarm:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm "research cloud architecture best practices"
```

### Step 3: Configure Swarm Parameters
You can specify additional parameters for more control:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm --mode=distributed --strategy=research "analyze user data trends"
```

</details>

### Step 4: Scale Your Swarm
For complex tasks, increase the number of agents:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm --agents=10 "research the development of a zero person startup"
```

> "So, I'm going to do a mode where I do 10 agents this time... Now, this is particularly well suited for really deep research because you can do it concurrently."

</details>

### Step 5: Monitor Swarm Execution
Watch your swarm work in real-time. You'll see:
- Individual agent status updates
- Memory coordination between agents  
- Task distribution and completion

## Advanced Swarm Features

### Memory Coordination
Swarms use shared memory to coordinate:

```bash
# Memory is stored as JSON for inter-agent communication
# Check memory files in your project directory
ls -la memory/
```

> "So the memory essentially allows it to give it a sort of short-term memory of what it's doing and what it's done in the past. And I'm using a super simple sort of approach to memory. I'm using just a sort of JSON style."

### High-Scale Operations
For intensive tasks, you can scale up significantly:

```bash
# Advanced: 50+ agent swarms for complex optimization
./claude-flow swarm --agents=50 --mode=hierarchical "optimize quantum network architecture"
```

> "I've done this at the 50 agents. I'm not going to do 50 agents right now because I know it'll max it out... 50 agents is just crazy it it can do all kinds of things"

</details>

## Common Use Cases

### Research Tasks
Swarms excel at deep research with concurrent information gathering:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm "comprehensive analysis of AI safety measures in autonomous systems"
```

### Optimization Projects
Use swarms for complex optimization problems:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm --mode=distributed "optimize performance benchmarks for distributed computing"
```

## Monitoring and Control

### Stop a Running Swarm
Use Ctrl+C or the stop command to halt execution:

```bash
# Interrupt running swarm
^C
```

### Resume Operations
Some swarms can resume from where they left off using stored state.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 3-5 agents for new projects
2. **Use Auto Mode**: Let the system determine optimal coordination initially  
3. **Monitor Resources**: Large swarms consume significant API credits
4. **Save Outputs**: Direct results to files for later analysis
5. **Test Incrementally**: Scale up gradually to understand performance characteristics

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting
If you hit API rate limits, reduce the number of concurrent agents or add delays between requests.

### Memory Issues  
Clear memory files if coordination becomes inconsistent:

```bash
rm -rf memory/
./claude-flow init spark --force
```

## Next Steps
- Explore specific agent types and roles
- Learn about custom swarm strategies
- Integrate with external tools and APIs
- Build persistent workflows for recurring tasks
