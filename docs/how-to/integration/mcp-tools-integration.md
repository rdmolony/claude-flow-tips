We've got the DAA, which is a sort of abstraction of that that allows for a kind of decentralized agent process. These are all built in Rust and compiled to a WASM."

## Steps

### Step 1: Understanding Available Tools
Claude Flow includes 87+ MCP tools across different categories:

- **Rust-based tools**: Compiled to WebAssembly for performance
- **DAA (Decentralized Agent Abstraction)**: For distributed agent processes
- **QDAG system**: Distributed darknet functionality
- **Neural network components**: ML and forecasting tools

</details>

### Step 2: Access MCP Tools in Swarms
MCP tools are automatically available to agents within swarms:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm "analyze system performance using available tools"
```

Tools will be automatically selected and used based on the task requirements.

### Step 3: Use Tools Programmatically
Access MCP tools through Claude's streaming interface:

```bash
claude -p --output-format=stream-json "use web search tools to research AI safety"
```

</details>

### Step 4: Monitor Tool Usage
When using streaming output, you can observe which tools are being invoked:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "tool": "web_search",
  "parameters": {"query": "Claude Flow documentation"}
}
```

This transparency allows you to understand how your tasks are being accomplished.

## Built-in Tool Categories

### Research and Web Search
```bash
# Tools automatically handle web research
claude "research the latest developments in autonomous agents"
```

</details>

### Performance and Benchmarking
```bash
# Use built-in performance analysis tools
./claude-flow swarm --mode=optimization "benchmark system performance"
```

### File and System Operations
Tools for file manipulation, system analysis, and automation are built into the platform.

### Neural Network and ML Tools
```bash
# Access ML tools for analysis and forecasting
claude "use neural forecasting tools to predict user growth"
```

</details>

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Step 5: Tool Chaining in Swarms
Swarms can chain multiple tools together for complex workflows:

```bash
./claude-flow swarm "use web search to gather information, then use analysis tools to process it, finally use neural forecasting to predict trends"
```

### Step 6: Custom Tool Integration
You can extend the tool library with custom MCP tools:

```typescript
// Example: Adding a custom tool to your Claude Flow setup
import { CustomTool } from './tools/custom-tool';

// Register custom tool with Claude Flow
claudeFlow.registerTool(new CustomTool());
```

### Step 7: Tool Performance Monitoring
Monitor tool performance and usage patterns:

```bash
# Use built-in monitoring tools
claude "analyze tool usage patterns and performance metrics"
```

## Web Dashboard Integration

### Step 8: Visualize Tool Usage
The Claude Flow web dashboard can display tool interactions:

```bash
# Start dashboard to monitor tool usage
./claude-flow dashboard --enable-tool-monitoring
```

## Security and Permissions

### Step 9: Tool Access Control
Some tools may require specific permissions:

```bash
# Grant necessary permissions for system tools
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "use system analysis tools"
```

### Step 10: Audit Tool Usage
Track which tools are being used and when:

```bash
# Enable tool usage logging
claude -p --output-format=stream-json --verbose "task with tool monitoring"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Let Tools Be Selected Automatically
Don't over-specify tool usage; let Claude Flow's intelligence select appropriate tools based on context.

### 2. Monitor Resource Usage
Some tools (especially ML and analysis tools) can be resource-intensive. Monitor performance impact.

### 3. Use Streaming for Tool Visibility
Use streaming output to understand tool selection and usage patterns.

### 4. Combine Tools in Workflows
Design workflows that leverage multiple tools in sequence for complex tasks.

### 5. Validate Tool Outputs
Always validate outputs from automated tool usage, especially for critical operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Available
- Verify Claude Flow version includes the required tools
- Check tool registration and initialization
- Ensure proper permissions are granted

### Performance Issues
- Monitor tool resource usage
- Consider using fewer concurrent tool operations
- Optimize tool parameters for your specific use case

### Integration Failures
- Check MCP protocol compatibility
- Verify tool configuration
- Review tool documentation for specific requirements

## Performance Optimization

### Rust-based Tools
The Rust-compiled tools offer superior performance:
