## Summary
instantiate any way you like so in this case
you i i did it that way now this is running
here so now it's suggesting here that
i've got uh and i wasn't fast enough so it's
decreasing it's so it's auto tuning itself
so in this case it's decided to reduce the
concurrency of agents to nine so i'm going to
go ahead and just grab this and we're going
to create yet another instance and then then
we're going to get the swarm to go do
something so this again this is the hive this
is the hive mind so create research oh what
are we gonna research any ideas
what what you guys want to create
research and create the most amazing
breakthrough of all time and build it.
