## Development Practices

### Specification-Driven Development
Always start with a clear, comprehensive specification before beginning agent-based development.

**Best Practice:**
1. Write 300-400 word specifications
2. Ask Claude to identify 10 unclear areas
3. Clarify all ambiguities
4. Step away and let agents execute

**Why it works:** Clear specifications prevent costly iterations and improve agent coordination efficiency.

**Confidence:** High

<details>
<summary>Source Reference</summary>

> "The better your specification the better the results... The team suggests specifying what you want beforehand in 300-400 words, and to ask Claude to clarify 10 things that are unclear or need to be improved, answer, then walk away."

### Parallel Agent Orchestration
Leverage batchtool for maximum efficiency by running agents in parallel rather than sequentially.

**Best Practice:**
1. Design tasks for parallel execution
2. Use batchtool to spawn multiple agent processes
3. Implement proper coordination mechanisms
4. Monitor and optimize parallel workflows

**Why it works:** Parallel execution dramatically reduces development time and improves resource utilization.

**Confidence:** High

> "The team suggests that batchtool is the key that makes it all work. Batchtool lets Claude Code spawn multiple agents as separate operating system processes which it can then orchestrate to run tasks in parallel"

## Security Practices

### Environment Isolation
Never run Claude Flow with disabled permissions on local development machines.

**Best Practice:**
1. Use Docker containers for local development
2. Prefer ephemeral cloud environments (GitHub Codespaces)
3. Never use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` locally
4. Implement proper access controls and monitoring

**Why it works:** Prevents credential exposure and system damage from AI agent actions.

**Confidence:** Critical

<details>
<summary>Source Reference</summary>

> "If you run claude --dangerously-skip-permissions locally outside of a sandbox (like Docker) claude will likely be able access any credentials you have locally & may even brick your machine (by editing your drivers) rendering it unusable. Please run it in either a sandbox or in an ephemeral cloud environment (like GitHub Codespaces)"

## Performance Optimization

### Topology Selection Strategy
Choose the appropriate swarm topology based on your specific use case and requirements.

**Best Practice:**
1. **Mesh topology:** For high collaboration requirements
2. **Hierarchical topology:** For structured, layered tasks
3. **Star topology:** For centralized coordination
4. **Ring topology:** For sequential processing chains

**Why it works:** Optimal topology selection reduces coordination overhead and improves performance.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Collaboration Patterns

### Bi-directional Communication Setup
Establish two-way communication channels for effective human-agent collaboration.

**Best Practice:**
1. Set up Slack or GitHub integration
2. Configure notification systems
3. Implement feedback loops
4. Monitor agent activities in real-time

**Why it works:** Bi-directional communication enables human oversight and continuous improvement.

**Confidence:** High

<details>
<summary>Source Reference</summary>

> "The team suggests using Slack or GitHub for bi-directional communication with agent swarms. We can setup 2-way sync between the swarm and GitHub"

Source: `spec.md:40` and `spec.md:52`
</details>

### Source Reference Management
Always maintain clear source references for extracted knowledge and decisions.

**Best Practice:**
1. Quote relevant source material
2. Include file names and line numbers
3. Maintain traceability for verification
4. Update references when sources change

**Why it works:** Proper source management enables verification and prevents hallucinated information.

**Confidence:** High

<details>
<summary>Source Reference</summary>

> "I want each reference to quote one (or more) relevant lines from the transcript, and reference the source transcript file name at those lines so I can check where each reference originates (and verify it isn't hallucinated)."
