**Difficulty:** easy

**Original Quote:**
> First, you need to set up a GitHub token with repo permissions. Then configure the GitHub integration in your claude-flow config. Create a project board, and finally set up webhooks so agents can create issues and update project status automatically.

**Quality Score:** 89%  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Original Quote:**
> Start by initializing the swarm with 'claude-flow init'. Then spawn your first agent - usually a researcher. Next, add a coder agent. Define the communication channels between them. Test with a simple task, then gradually add more agents like a tester or reviewer as needed.

**Quality Score:** 94%  
**Difficulty:** easy

**Original Quote:**
> Create a Dockerfile with the Claude environment. Configure volume mounts for your project files. Set up networking for agent communication. Run with --security-opt no-new-privileges. Finally, use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple agent containers.

**Quality Score:** 87%  
**Difficulty:** hard

**Original Quote:**
> Define your message schema first. Create a message broker - Redis works well. Implement producer and consumer interfaces in each agent. Add message routing logic. Set up error handling and retries. Finally, implement monitoring so you can see message flow between agents.

**Quality Score:** 85%  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Original Quote:**
> Profile your current performance first. Identify bottlenecks - usually it's sequential operations. Implement parallel task execution using BatchTools. Cache common operations. Use agent specialization to reduce context switching. Monitor resource usage and scale horizontally when needed.
