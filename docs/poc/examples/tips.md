## 💭 Tip 2: Specify Requirements in 300-400 Words Before Starting

The better your specification, the better the results. Take time to write a clear 300-400 word description of what you want, then ask Claude to clarify 10 things that are unclear or need improvement.

**Original Quote:**
> I always tell people - spend the time upfront to write a really good specification. 300-400 words describing exactly what you want. Then ask Claude to point out 10 things that might be unclear or could be improved. Fix those, then start your work.

## 🎯 Tip 3: Use Batch Operations for Performance

BatchTools is the key that makes it all work. It allows Claude Code to spawn multiple agents as separate OS processes and orchestrate them to run tasks in parallel, giving you 2-4x performance improvements.

**Original Quote:**
> BatchTool is really the secret sauce here. Instead of running things sequentially, you can spawn multiple agents and have them work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. We're seeing 2-4x speed improvements in real projects.

## 💭 Tip 4: Use GitHub for Bi-Directional Communication

Set up two-way sync between your swarm and GitHub for better project management. This allows agents to create issues, update project boards, and coordinate through familiar development workflows.

**Tools mentioned:** github, slack

**Original Quote:**
> We've found that integrating with GitHub - having agents create issues, update project boards, even make pull requests - creates this really nice feedback loop. You can use Slack or GitHub discussions for bi-directional communication with your swarm.

## 🎯 Tip 5: Start Simple, Then Scale Your Swarm

Don't try to build a 10-agent swarm on day one. Start with 2-3 agents for a simple task, get that working well, then gradually add complexity. Each agent should have a clear, specific role.

**Original Quote:**
> My advice is always start small. Get a researcher and a coder working together first. Once that's solid, maybe add a tester. Build up your swarm gradually - don't try to orchestrate 10 agents right away.
