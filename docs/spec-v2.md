## Extraction Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Extraction
1. Parse transcript files for keyword patterns
2. Identify potential content blocks by category markers
3. Extract surrounding context (±5 lines)
4. Generate candidate entries with source references

### Phase 2: Manual Verification
1. Review each candidate entry for accuracy
2. Verify quotes match source transcripts exactly
3. Ensure line number references are correct
4. Add clarifying context where needed

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference
1. Link related entries across categories
2. Build searchable index
3. Generate navigation structure
4. Create category summaries

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Requirements
- ✅ Every quote must link to exact line numbers in source transcript
- ✅ All code examples must be tested for syntax validity
- ✅ Commands must include version compatibility notes
- ✅ Each entry must have minimum 2 source references
- ✅ Automated CI checks for broken links and references

### Review Process
1. **Extraction Review**: Verify quote accuracy and context
2. **Technical Review**: Validate code examples and commands
3. **Editorial Review**: Ensure clarity and consistency
4. **Community Review**: Open PR for feedback before merge

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Coverage: >80% of video content extracted
- Verification: 100% of entries have valid source links
- Searchability: <3 clicks to find any topic
- Freshness: Updated within 48 hours of new video release

### Qualitative
- New users can find answers to common questions independently
