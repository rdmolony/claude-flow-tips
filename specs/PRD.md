# Product Requirements Document: Claude Flow Knowledge Extractor

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
Create an AI-powered knowledge extraction system that transforms Claude Flow community video transcripts into structured, searchable, and verifiable documentation. This tool will democratize access to Claude Flow expertise by converting scattered video content into organized, actionable guidance.

### Problem Statement
The Claude Flow community has produced valuable video content on https://video.agentics.org/, but this knowledge is:
- Difficult to search and reference quickly
- Time-consuming to consume (requires watching entire videos)
- Not easily verifiable or cross-referenced
- Inaccessible to those who prefer text-based learning

### Solution
An AI system that automatically extracts, categorizes, and documents key insights from video transcripts, creating a comprehensive knowledge base with full source attribution and verification capabilities.

## 2. Product Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Accessibility**: Make Claude Flow knowledge easily discoverable and consumable
2. **Verification**: Ensure all extracted information is traceable to source material
3. **Organization**: Structure knowledge into intuitive categories for quick reference
4. **Community Growth**: Lower the barrier to entry for new Claude Flow users

### Success Metrics
- Number of unique insights extracted per transcript
- User engagement with documentation (page views, time on page)
- Reduction in repeated questions in community forums
- Time saved for users finding specific information (baseline: watching full videos)
- Accuracy of extracted information (verified against source)

## Appendix: Example Extraction

### Input (Transcript Excerpt):
```
[00:12:34] So the really important thing to understand here is that 
if you run claude with the dangerously-skip-permissions flag locally 
outside of a sandbox like Docker, claude will likely be able to access 
any credentials you have locally and may even brick your machine by 
editing your drivers, rendering it unusable. Please run it in either 
a sandbox or in an ephemeral cloud environment like GitHub Codespaces 
so that it cannot do so.
```

### Output:
```markdown
# Gotcha: Security Risk with Permission Bypass

Running Claude Flow with disabled permissions outside of a sandboxed environment poses severe security risks including credential exposure and potential system damage.
