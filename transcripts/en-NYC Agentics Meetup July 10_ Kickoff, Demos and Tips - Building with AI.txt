coming. My name is Zohar. I'm with Kaltura. I'm a
Kaltura. I'm a Kaltura. uh we're part of the
sponsoring partners for the Agentics
Foundation and i'm happy to have you all here
joining us this is the very first meetup for
the Agentics Foundation in new york with
chapters all over the world now and this is
the first chapter um the whole concept joe
will give some more details about it uh in a
bit i just want to take a thank you for louis
our friend here who but yeah thank you
so much for coming I hope you enjoyed this
I hope this is going to be the kickoff
of a wonderful group for H&X engineering
and people who are Avid and curious
and interested in the world
of a young age, which is probably
one of these. Thank you for coming. Hello, everybody.
I'm Willy. Very nice to meet you. Willy Vansicle the III. And I'd say about
six-ish months ago, maybe even less
than that. Right, I was just on
LinkedIn and scrolling and it's AI
Hackerspace Fridays. Someone's like my, okay, so I put this, okay? And it's people
building things with AI, right? And I'm
like, okay, this is great. This is what
I've been doing, okay? Not to make this
like all about me and what I've done, But,
like, I didn't, like, I'm not a developer,
right, because I was a salesperson for
a lifetime of life. And ChatGPT came
out, it was nice. I started using it to
help automate some of my, like, sales
activities, right? And quickly wanted to
do more, right? I was like, hey, I want to
do more of this, like, I need to do internet,
I need to do more. So here, there, and
then do this, right? ChatGPT was like,
dude, you want to go, no, right? What do
you mean? I don't know anything about that,
anything about that. You say that, right? So I start copying
and pasting code from ChatGPT to get
the VS code, right? Running like Python
scripts, streamlit things, and like
here we are now, like a year and
three months later, and like I've got
the key websites, like I'm actively
contributing to production
level code at like enterprise
software company. So it's really
incredible what this stuff can
do in terms of like turning your
career around. People that are
looking for a pivot more, looking to
like, I don't know, just do something
different with my education and
stuff, right? Just dig in a little
bit, like roll this. So anyways, what is
the Agentics Foundation? So, this was founded
by Reuven Cohen, about like, technically like
eight years ago it was officially founded,
right, it's a non -profit organization,
and we're basically dedicated to making
AI innovation and education open
to everybody, okay, by supporting the
development and deployment of open
source agency and AI. So, we're basically
a group of people that are out
here building open source software,
teaching people how to use AI,
running workshops, training people,
having these meetups, there we are, right?
So what is agendics? We're all familiar with
AI, ChatGPT, right? It's coming up with
ChatGPT before, right? But agendics, it's a
little bit different, right? So we're
talking about a field of study, okay,
focused on the design, developing, deployment of these intelligent,
autonomous systems, okay, that are capable
of like receiving where they're at,
what's going on, reasoning, making some
decisions, and then taking action, right,
with your software, with them, whatever
you're finding, right. Okay, so they're
proactive, they're autonomous, collaborative,
they're not targeted, we create some issues
with these agents who are not just chatting
and chatting to them. Definitely not copy
and paste the code, it's amazing, right.
So a little bit more about the Agentics
Foundation here, we believe the next
generation of builders should not be limited to
these big multinational corporations, with
Agentics, builders can come from all
walks of life, right? A year and a half
ago, I was making cold calls and
sending emails, but now I'm running
websites and building rapid prototypes
and APIs, right? So, the foundations
that have impact. We have in-person
events, that's why you're here, regional
chapters around the world. Google
sponsored for London. We've got Toronto
is big, Austin, a lot of
different things. Research and
development, we have these calls every
week. Get out, we brainstorm together,
we act together, Reuven shows us the
latest thing that we look the world
with. It's pretty amazing, right? So
our community now, I think these numbers
are a little outdated because I think we're
actually at about 1,300, 1,400
registered members now. We're on Reddit,
we're on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Discord,
all over the place after this event.
We're going to go ahead and share
some of those Discord and links for
you guys to get involved and start
connecting with us. On every Friday, we
have the AI Afterspace, that Zoom call
that I was telling you about, where a
ton of people get on there from all over
the world and demo, we kind of do like
what we're gonna do today, like we'll
show a little demo, we'll talk a little
bit about HNC AI and the latest
developments. I will push to
the young logo this week and
then we ship, right, it's a
great community, right. And so I'm
gonna talk just a little strange bit here because some real
guys are gonna get up afterwards and
show, right, but, Who's heard of
bio-coding so far? Maybe it's
your family. Okay, we've all heard
of bio-coding, right? They've got Andrew
Barclay's name, famous, right?
And then we flew up, and now it's
almost like, oh, it's kind
of bio-coding, right? So there's two, or not just two, there's
a lot of different ways to code with
AI, but we're just talking about two of
these like sort of primary categories
you can put them into, right? And one is,
is this my book, right? It's, hey, AI,
make a to-do app for me with a really cool
space background. You know, I'll
make the buttons red, this and that.
You're not really worried about
infrastructure. You're not really worried about architecture. You're not like
telling the AI, like, hey, make sure that
this code is scalable and it goes here and,
you know, use this method for the same
thing. You just buy it out, like trying
to get the AI to build something that you
want to do, right? It's flow, there's
a human, it's always a feedback
loop in there, right? You're
always, you know, change this button,
hey, no, this, hey, I need you to do that,
and the other, right? Change that now to
agentic engineering, okay? And we move to
a more refined, structured process,
okay? Where our machine is now
in the process. And instead of
me having to go back every
single time, my AI writes
a test for it, right, and then tests
it, and then comes back and fixes it, and then
comes back and tests it again, and then comes
back, and you know, we get this feedback
loop until the task is done, and then we
can move on, right, once a B and C has completed,
then we move into this orchestration
layer, and this sort of, I don't want to call
it an arc, but like we put a lot of work into
context engineering, like what exactly is
each LLM called getting, how are we designing
all this open so there's a lot more thought
process that goes into it's a lot more
structured and and the results aren't just you
know AI slot one of the results are production
great software results are you know these
open source libraries that are now you know
16-1700 stars with uh group's new uh cloud
flow implementation so um pretty cool stuff
here that we're doing uh agentic engineering
versus bi-coding there's a big difference here
uh but bi-coding is So cool guys. Thank you for
listening to me. I'm here to chat
a little bit. Again, I'm really
fanciel of the public ambassador
of this and the Gensys Foundation
crew, but I'm a person so yeah, no
big deal, right? So we're going to
let Ocean get up here and share a little bit
of what he's doing. Thank you. Don't forget you
share your screen. Give it up for Ocean. Hello, my name's Nohishu,
I am one of the co -founder of the HNX
Foundation. So about one and a half, two years
ago, I started a, right now we know it's
like agent stuff, but back then nobody really
asked what AI agent organization framework
was. So I was on that, and then that was a
quick small line AGI. Eventually, so about last year,
around April, I met with them, and then
I quickly got very interested because
our passion are very similar and he was
very enthusiastic about like I was very
happy about that. So basketball working
now and then we have actually made the
Jetsons Foundation a real nonprofit. I'm so
happy about that and it's so great to see
all of you guys here. So what we are hyping
about nowadays is the all-you-can
-ease plan called and Nordic Club both.
Whoop! The $200 plan, it used to be meters,
and then everything that I'm going to
show you today might cost is hundreds
of dollars during the demo, but no,
it's only good for me. Anyway, so I ended
up quite wanting to talk about today,
so I was chatting with the client,
what should we talk about? I want to
demonstrate you, right, so tell me what
you want to demo. and then it come up
with um now i have so let's get started
with the cloud code basically it is
a command line it is a command line
interface uh that allows you to programmatically
interact with uh solid bottom so
what i'm going to show you right now is
okay we're going to How about warm-up joke, which is the last thing
we're going to do, I'm talking
about warm-up joke. All right, option
one, how many AI patients
does it take to change your life
more? Just one, it needs to
correlate with some research agents,
but let's talk about an architect
agent to design the blockchain
for a firm, and a critic agent
to tune down. As you can see, I
have brainwashed my cloud to refer me
as Ocean whenever. It's really fun because
today you've got to speak with very
casual, and this whole system has been
completely personalized to understand how
I work for them. All right, this is Lyon. I'm going to give
it an impossible problem, and so we
can watch our song. All right, this
is perfect. Oh, perfect, yeah. Great. Nice. Now I have to
improvise and go to Devogar because
whatever I was trying to show,
go my over here. Yeah, all right,
let's try again, so change plan and
let's get started, so I'll explain So I'm trying to change
the demo planer, I don't realize this is
going to be, so I'll use . Atosication basically
is when Cloakville wants to get something
done, it does not do what it's, it has
the option to not do itself. Instead,
it will basically delegate that problem
to a task agent, which is the sub-process
independent of the main flow, and then
that task agent will still get stuff done,
come back to the orchestrator and then
we connect to it. So what the lighting
orchestrator is, is a… so in cloud
flow, actually, we were talking
about the task agent. One problem with
that is let's say we have five agents
working in parallel and that is kind of
the initial concept of Squam. We have a
lot of agents working on kind of the same
project but one problem with having
them and agents working together is the
coordination problem. So what if two agents
or three agents are editing the same file?
What if the agents are editing file and then
another agent is doing my testing then you
know as here change that was a problem so every
agent will come back to you and say I have
completed my test and then when you put all
this stuff together it's broken and that
is a major problem what we are trying to
resolve with this small coordination system um
so you can brute force it as how I'm showing
you right now which is a, let's actually take
a look at what the plan looks like from
the illustration output. So right now the task agents are doing
their work. The swarm system
basically allows each of the task agents
to report their current status to a
centralized place to, yeah, kind of
database where we well use neural
network to train kind of a topology
in real time according to whatever
they have done. The interesting
thing is, even with other neural net
training, the topology feature
by itself already dramatically in the
quality of language, which is something
it's so traumatic that all the sleep didn't
really expect it before, that's why I
jumped into this form that I'm helping out
with developing rust. So anyway, so right
now it's like to show us a consensus
theory framework. Let's see what it is. Let's actually do this.
This looks cool. Why are we showing the regular concentration? We are in New York. We are in New York. Question is, is
the code based task agent being
actually written? Yes, so, but what, as I can
see, I want to explain the observability
following a bit. And then, as you can see, like
all those tossing and they're doing their
thing and you just see that it did become
bigger and bigger. So here it has already
made 45 changes. I don't know what's
called where. However, how you can try to
understand what they're doing live would be...
Now I can start this. Okay, let's do
it like this. So, you have all the
issues on GitHub. And then, have your
task agents to provide live feedback on GitHub
issues as comments. So, you know, I'll show you a brief one. I was using
Swarm to develop Swarm. And then
while the... while they are remaining, I have to be there. The memory is
all beneficial. The public itself
is just... The public itself
is just direct video icons to
the Sony platform. Everything that you
want to have in the public, like automation,
like locks on memory, It's all additional,
that's part of which it's an engineer,
otherwise it's just fine. All right, so
it has posted on the issue, so
let's take a look. Yeah, reach which report. You're right, let's check which report
actually, yeah. Yeah, they do have
this, and you do need to kind of watch
out, but I could have had this
information earlier. All right, so now
it's having a vision. Yeah, I was just curious. Once you set this
up, do you ask about how do you believe
that? How do you basically evaluate
how effective it is? Just, you know, you
tend to block them. Yes, I'll give that
a bit. There's a whole different
methodology behind it. So what I'm
showing you right now is the
depth portion of how they are
coding them along. So right now
we just saw the agent opened three issues regarding our
demo today. And as they are
working along, so they will post
comments here. So they probably need
to sort of batch up them, but they do
need to clean up the UI, because otherwise
they want to . best. So now let me show you
what the evaluation framework might
be like. It's actually more traditional
than my thought. So LionGate is a
Rust framework for capability-based
security really well, that aims to provide
very fine-grained control and access rights
for each individual agent. So what you're
seeing right here, every single task agent,
they actually have the same access right
to everything as for main log streamer,
which is not ideal. And then in the... So
I had this idea about back in February with
NCP, and then there was that very... uh serious
security vulnerability within the enterprise
itself especially when everything is
configured once and then you are doing with
the multi-agent system so i thought how about
we start to you know give every single uh
agent in a multiple telecom a capability of
what they can access to our system um so i get
that back in memory and then took a few
minutes ago i thought is it really good is it
really the climate state of the art like you
know and i was claiming so i So I said, how
about you do me a formal mathematical proof
of the entire thing? Everything needs to
be there based with extensive research that
I know I'm interested. So basically saying,
show me the map. And what the slow system
was able to put my work in two weeks for
that rust paper, and then it was able to
prove this in a morning. What's fun about all
of this is I actually did not read too
much into it, however I had a process
that keep on finding logical defaults
from the previous one, and then up to
a little iteration, I guess I will start
to dig into it once I want to make
architectural changes because ASK was
validating the thing. It's become to play
a lot of faults on my previous architecture
decisions which I actually need to go
in because it is a kind of like a personal
text in 100 watts. All right, so let's go back and take a look. We have to put some
comments in the topology design for the
heterosubestification method. Set the cyber phenomenon, DLT, block the
data structure, application, pull. And then here's
the training system with
security analysis. I'm not sure if I'd
be able to mute. It might be
overfitting due to the existing data I
already had in there. That's why I keep
on mentioning about Baceton-Bosmores. All right, yeah, this is, yeah, the weird is that
testing. Yeah, so that is
basically the entire development
cycle of agentic engineering at the
very PowerPoint. There are so much more tools to be explored. I'm very unhappy
that I wasn't able to share
this one today. I just wrote
it last minute. What is enabling is
something in automated intelligence according
to your own wish that... So, for example,
the entire foundation of that was the fast
-growing network high -found package, and
then Reuven took that, put it into PLUSD,
and I stepped in, and then I added the GPU
training functionality to it. The crazy
thing is, I do not know how to keep it
works other than I have some very big
ideas about it, nor do I know what a shader
is, or what a WGS SL file works. But
I was able to get a whole thing done in
a day, and it works. Then you need to go back
to that mathematical improvement
methodology to actually prove that what is
working is actually logically sound. So it
is really crazy to even show all of this
web GPU stuff that I literally could not
really think of. But now, I actually have a pretty
decent understanding of what is blood,
also with debug, and yeah, so that's
about it. I'm super happy to see all of you guys
here, and this fast -moor network is
already functional. It supports CPU and CPU
training, and we are going to integrate this into
this blog such that the neural net training
We have time to optimize topology can actually
be very helpful. And we're very excited
to see what that should mean for the next
phase of each of these. Thank you guys so much. Thank you, thank
you. Give it up one more
time for Ocean. Right. So next in line, following the same
sort of financial stock trading
thing, we have Anie. She has a demo here for something that she does. If you want to see
the screen, then HDMI. or she can share
the url with you oh great yeah we see we're on it go back oh no worries that's fine we'll just do it with you Hey, well hello everyone.
My name is Kanye. I am at VATS.ai
and today I want to show you the AI
agent that I built. So, how many of you guys
have asked to do it? So, we built a
framework called entity agents. Basically, in the framework
that allows agents So I'll tell you a
letter about how it works first and then
I will walk you to the... So basically
what it does is that it helps my boyfriend
make better financial decisions by
knowing 35 stops in quick search, 35 stops,
multiple IDs, etc. So it has
multiple agents. And then, yeah, so the first part
is data submission. So it has two main
agents. The data, it shows the
first agent for my data, the second
agent is for that, so the data is at a perfect high
level of law, and then you
have the analyst, the analyst has a
financial analyst point to view, so it analyzes
the data, and then you have the data
to be recorded as well. data and then
provide a really nice work. And we're using
different, we're using different workflows
based on a project, so like the
orchestrator, like how agents, how the
orchestrator have access to agents and allow
agents to make calls to communicate but
also have access to So, in this
specific example, the agents have
access to Facebook, Google search tool, and then 5%
provide the report. So I went ahead and
wrote a Streamlit. I'm going to
share it here. Streamlit. Okay. Let's see. Okay, so this is
the Streamlit. So basically it's my
portfolio, I have the following stocks and
then here I search any other stocks, so
if you didn't want to search no other
financial or like stock. So now I'm with AAPL,
then you're on that. So basically you're going to start finding it. Then I'm working for what I'm starting with
it. I'm going to do something
that I contribute a lot, but it's
going to be a slide of like how it's
going to do a call. So it's accessing
different tools like fetch and it's like
starting to look for data about apple and like
beta is a financial view of that apple it
is for its earnings and quite so um and
you should be different uh mcp server so so
these are the dots basically this is the main goal So how it works is
that you have to, it's very hollow and
it's very simple. So basically we
have an agent. So this agent
is going to be based on the
founder agent. And they have exactly
what they want the agent to put a paper
together at this board. And now the better
the content here it is, the better
the engine is. So that is that. And
then here you also give it apples to
school. So here I give it apples to the prior
person so that I can actually stay through
reports in my files. So the first phase
is the quality of the whole component of it,
so it's like a gather data and then check
to figure out the data for the quality and
then we just now will tie it to against reverse
reporting so that's the value that I
corporate have been in and the core of the
workforce and the next thing about the agent
is the core framework. So yeah, and if you can give it about the data, different agents
and then different instructions So this
is the evaluator agent. Again, the evaluator agent
says what is good, what is excellent, what is
fair for this form. And then on that, the
agent tries to look for it to stop and
then go to the end. So yeah, let's see if our
report is done yet. So, for example, this is one of the most recent run the other ones
i ran it at 627. so start price is
$16 so it's changed it's not in fact because How I can improve it
is that it has a big gap for national data
from Apple Advantage. The nice thing about
it is also that should you hold
on to it or should you accept? So if
you go to Apple one, it tells you about Apple, the Apple YouTube, and gives you access
to the slides. For example,
here, it tells you if you
should buy more. What is the accuracy
level for each stock analysis on holding
or selling them? So you should
never trust AI. um but basically
this is not about the video i was just
trying to show you the possibilities of like
what you can build uh with these like
frameworks that are really composable
and you can work with it's basically like
a block change change depending together
and box you can make it as accurate.
Again, you can add APIs to it, you can
add an mcp server, like a web server
that will be automated and understand how
people are talking about different
stocks or companies, because a lot of
times, like, public opinion about how a
company is really, and that affects
the stocks. So there's a lot of
different moments you can access and maybe
a macro response. Okay, so that's where
the that you're not planning to
really understand if this is the quality
that you want it or not, and you set the
quality. So if you say what are the
mistakes, what are the areas where you're going
on, or let the handle run and then what
are the things to do for and what are the
criteria for the data so it keeps going
into a loop until it gets to learn
about their kids now I think we are
a good person. We are a good person. Every single person
can be a good person. Yeah, I think I can. I think I can
start up so far. I think I can
start up so far. I think I can do it. I think I can do it. Yeah, I think. Me. yeah so mcp agent
so mcp is for It's like a new
one to make a tool call. It's
kind of like an API that gives
access to points. We haven't served a day rise for a couple days. What we're doing is
that when Anthropy came out, they
also came out with a different work
frame, stuff like how this new call
should be made. And then what we did
is that we actually took that. like this is
actually happening with the way the age of
communication as well so for example there's
different workflows that the orchestrator
works well the activator works well like you
have bunch of uh work in parallel workflow
where you have a bunch of agents with something
in parallel and then you add them and
kind of have this all so that's what we're
doing what we're doing If you want to learn more, you can do it here. Tanya. NCP agent, that
library is sick, hey? I just built
something with that NCP agent
in Slackbot. We built that thing
on the conference, it works better
than any grad. right so great we
have one more demo for you guys here I don't
know what this one is about surprise But the
guy is really good. Oh, right. . Yeah, so you need to . You only remember, your CPH was
great because it has a little NCT file. It's inside your
Python script. All right, so you put
that in the Python script, and then you can
make anything in NCT. Right, so any Python
script you write can now be an NCT
file. You don't have to only block
code for all of the computers, for all
of the computers. Right, everybody
give it up for... Wait, wait y'all,
give it up there. Wait, okay, wait, now...
Give it up there! I made this app at a hackathon. Me and Isaac are
actually very private. I made it in like
one day. I just had it done like
four months ago. And so then you
put the, like, buying code, like,
for the course of the end of the
school. Let's go. Woo! And that's not localhost? No, it's not
localhost. Shhh. Okay, so welcome
everybody to Lease Daddy.
We're rents. Yeah. Alright, cool,
hashtag New York. So when you rent an
apartment, you often get a lease from a
landlord, and you have a short amount
of time to figure out whether it's good
or not, and a short window where you can
do anything about it, regardless of exactly
the same thing. And so I'm just going
to quickly make a lease. I didn't know
how it was going to demo today, so I'm going
to just make a lease. That's cool, just go over my chat so you
can see it. No, you can take
it, I'm taking it, really,
you can go on. We want to support
our business in New York and maybe a new
conference at PDF. And maybe we want
a couple of red flags or like two
problematic expenses. Yeah. A couple of hidden
really unfair terms. So we're going
to do that. We're going to create a
PDF for ourselves. When we doubled this
at the hackathon, we had a friend who
was in Seattle, and he wouldn't think
they had a terrible lease that had like
this horrible security deposit thing, and
he got *******. So we actually
used a lease. Okay, so we're
generating a PDF here. This turns into a PDF,
but we can get it. It's not worth
generating that. This isn't the cool
part of the demo. Let's see if it worked. Did it give you a PDF? Oh, it did. I
see big lease. Good job. Big job AI. Checking the user was a good job. Yeah, like, yeah. This is the hardest
part of the demo. Okay. Okay. I'm just
going to analyze our lease. So if you take
a second to profit, what's happening is it's
an API called Anthropic, and it's not super
eugentic, but there's like a couple of
rounds of communication that are happening
in order to make some different outcomes that
will come up shortly. So I think the first
thing that you kind of need to know as a
renter are like, is this good or bad, and
what the red flag, what should I ask about
this? But the second thing is like what
can you do about it? So we kind of took
the approach to the very healthy community
Like if you if you've rented the board
multiple times You kind of know that
like there's kind of certain things that you
should and shouldn't say and that you
should and shouldn't do So I think that's
kind of the focus is to help
enable users to So I haven't even
looked at the lease yet. So here we see And when there is a
relatively variable, it does say it's a
fairly... But here there's a heavily
skewed at the landlord. Okay. One more time we'll
see what ChatGPT did and see
whether Anthropik could determine
what ChatGPT did. So we have a crazy
event increase. I'm kind of
curious to look at the actual lease. um um i'm using this for sure um does anybody
see an actual red flag so we
can check yeah yeah Yeah, yeah, so
here we have our 14 days
notice right there Yeah, so we found this Issues and then the
next question is what can you do about it?
So at some point you have to go and tell
the landlord about this So here we have the
draft email, and so here we have a pre
-drafted email that uses information from
this and provides a draft that you
can send directly. And then sometimes
you're arguing for better terms, but
sometimes you don't have to communicate in a
way so that you can draft with ones that
are more about getting a discount for
different terms. terms this one's very like
strongly worded like your lawyer friend
might might have the gumption to provide
um you get action acquired kind of thing
um we decided to just kind of keep keep
going with it um get very generative we
have one called rampage No, but there's a, we
should have like an MCP to go like extremely
on it, so if anybody So the other thing
we built is there's an AI coach where you
can actually use a chat bot to go
practice simulated conversations and this
is designed to be like dismissive and kind of not
really interested in this as a
regular landlord But it will actually
give in at some point if you are being really
convincing. So if you just go into
something like, you know Generic, you might not
get a good result as the landlord has a lot
they can do on what he hates at it. So
we'll see how it goes. Okay, so yeah. Section 14
needs to be 10% different. I
think we'll get a little more
specific. I am out. So we'll try to get a little more
specific to see. Were you able to
bring in the actual context from WIse terms
into the supposition? Yeah, they are
directly used in here. So we have a, and
there's also a rank -based implementation
where we can get WIse terms from other
WIse, like, whole corpus of WIse.
Other whole corpus. So you hooked up
to like a WIse API. Yeah. So yeah, that's WeSteady. There's also
a phone agent, but it's not
running right now. You can actually
call and do the same thing on
phone call. Nice. So yeah, that's WeSteady. It's only so identical,
but I'm proud of us being able to
go in really fast, with a lot of
coding knowledge. And if you're interested
in checking it out, But this isn't
something more like pursuing super deeply,
but it does work and you can go try
it if you want to. Yeah, that's
LeafDaddy. And who are you?
What do you do? Oh, so I'm Dan. I'm building
a product for energy investors. Please. Ok, well, it's p0-meet
-daddy-addy-daddy -daddy-addy-addy
-addy-addy-addy-addy -addy. I'll put it
in your classroom. QR, I'm gonna take my YG. Okay. Guys, and then, we just have one more person. Thanks, give it up for
Dan, I get it back. We have one more person,
wanted to share a little bit about their
non-profit options. Hi, I'm Anatole,
and I'm nervous, nice to see all of you. Public speaking
voice is fun, right? Wasn't prepared
to talk, so I put some notes
on my phone. But yeah, I'm Anatole,
technology manager for Rewriting the
Code, just joined a few months ago, a really
great organization uh we support a community
of 36 000 women uh specifically early career
and in college with uh sorry still learning
uh access to mentorship resources in-person
events virtual events and currently
we're preparing our ai curriculum uh
for me i've always been fascinated with
with automation, AI, I mean,
stuff's amazing. So I've come from that
background and we're figuring out what does
our community want? What are people really
looking to learn to be prepared for what's
coming in this year? And at least from
my perspective, it's created this really
interesting situation, yeah, reading
through my notes, where a lot
of what people are learning in college is dating,
right? Because so much of this has
come out now. So with a lot of
early careers, they're either not
hiring or they're looking for people
who already have experience with a lot
of these AI tools. So there's this
big gap that's being realized now
and I think will soon be realized
even greater. And I'm sure we can
agree that the value of a college education,
a college degree in particular, is always
a little questionable. It's really
been about what you're doing with
it. What have you done with
your experience? So with this, how do you prepare? How do
you get ready? And I guess as it relates
to my organization, how can we better
prepare our community to be ready for
what's coming? Online, I've spoken
with a lot of teachers, a lot of teams, and
they've asked, how do we teach our students to
use an AI, or they're not just using AI to
answer the questions, but to be a tool, a co-pilot, something
that they know how to work with, so that
they can go into the job force ready to use
these tools you know a tool is an asset
something to work with it would be better
and not just not have a job so I know about
one thing has said many times he said
I'm not doing this to replace people with work
sorry replace people with AI I'm doing
this give one person the power of 200 so that
they can do anything themselves and be
empowered And I think that's aligned with
that concept, really empowering students
coming into the space to do anything,
to really come prepared for
what's coming. So I know in my
opinion, I feel a lot of that
curriculum should really be focused
on exactly that. Teaching people how to use AI in their field. There's so much
that you can learn in AI. Honestly,
we'd love to hear any of your opinions
on what people need to be prepared
for the future. And to close, I mean,
I'll just say again, in the coming year or
two, I really think it's going to be an
interesting period. I mean, students have
been going to college for four years, learning
all of this stuff that technically
cannot be applicable with a lot of the jobs
that are hiring, and it'll take time for
that to get there, but I think we'll really
start seeing that. And that's the question
that I'm trying to answer and figure
out, how do we best prepare our community
for what's coming um with the tools what do
they need to know and uh yeah if you'd like
to talk about this if you have any
suggestions we'd love to guys that's all i
got for presenters thank you all
for coming and before i let you
guys go Okay, this is the first
New York City Agentics Foundation
to meet up, okay? I don't know how
many people actually know about the
Agentics Foundation before you came
here, right? So I'm going to, in
the blast that I send you guys after this,
hook you up with like a couple of
URLs where you can go and get plugged in,
right? Where you can get like in this
community be where we are like pushing the
boundaries what people are doing, they
act. All of these naysayers that people
are like, oh, we can't do this, oh, we're
being very careful. Just go all in and
trust everybody that's telling
you. Because like, just . Guys, that's really
it, like network hangout, I think
we have to be kicked out of here
like 7:15 or 7:30. but a big shout
out to zohar
