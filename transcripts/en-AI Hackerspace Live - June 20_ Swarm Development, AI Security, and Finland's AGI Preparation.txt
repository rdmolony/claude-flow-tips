two, one. And here we are, AI
Hackerspace, June 20th. What a week. I guess
it's not a great week if you're into security,
but what a week what we're having.
And yet again, a spectacular week in AI.
Every week is crazier than the last, at
least for me it is. So we've got a great
show lined up today. Rob, who do we
got? Yeah, yeah, a bunch of
stuff going on. We've got the Paris event now is on the
map officially for monday the 23rd and uh
kelsey cole vincent and emad are putting that
together that should be a lot of fun um
for the we've got the new york city crew
that are planning out the first event they're
going to be joining us today they got a
couple tools to share or a tool to share as
well and then we'll get a recap from mondweep
and bensa they've got a heck of a week
in London with that panel on sustainable
AI development at Greenwich University
and then their hackathon which has been running
since Wednesday so we'll get an update
from them then as well we've had a lot of
help the last few weeks from our long-time
member Dimple she's a data and AI engineer out
of Edinburgh Scotland she's been helping
with getting everything together for the
guests. And I think we have Miko as well. Is
that right, Dimple? Yeah, Rob. So thank
you. We have Miko. He's a longtime member
as well. And he has founded seven tech
startups with three exits. And he has a new
startup. And the mission is to build
the infrastructure of the Nordic welfare
state with AI. So yeah, over
to you, Rob. right wonderful that's
great i'm really looking forward to hearing
how that uh about this project um miko we're
going to start that the lightning talks
probably around 12 20 something along those
lines but it's really clear that finland gets
it and they're working on some fascinating
stuff to to sincerely prepare for the imminent
arrival of agi so that will be fascinating
so that's the lineup today roof all right so
it sounds sounds like we got a great show
line so some of the originals i'll we'll try
to get everyone in um this week for me has
been particularly interesting around swarm
based development so i i've got a bit of a uh
i don't know obsession might be the right
word with with you know applying sort of swarms
to various things and i so i'm learning a
lot about the sort of application of the
these kind of complex swarms to various types of
development and securing and deploying and
all kinds of things. But there's a few
takeaways that I want to discuss, you know, first
and foremost. And it starts with this exploit,
which we don't know a lot about. And
there's been a massive password breach from
the biggest providers of OA. And the reason
this is kind of worrisome is,
you know, if you've ever logged
into any website using Google or
Facebook or Apple, that means you're
trusting these providers to secure your
authentication information, right? So then that's
why you can log in with one click with
your Apple or Google. And it would seem that
16 billion passwords, which is double the
population of the planet, basically, in
terms of passwords, was leaked relatively
recently, apparently last month. we're just
finding about it now well what's interesting
about this and i have this is all
anecdotal by the way i've got no proof of who or
what or how so i can only sort of uh you
know surmise what that potentially could be
but what's interesting is the fact that it's
never been easier to hack right and this
idea mostly uh has been around concepts
of like kitty scripters right get get these
various tools like nets you know metasploit
and other kind of tools and and then sort
of click a few things in your keyboard and
see what happens. That's been the
traditional approach. But now what we're
seeing is we can kind of take that and we
can amp that up using these agentic tools
that we use these kind of kitty scripting
tools, but can also like sort of
adaptively look and discover. So what's
my sense, and I have no proof of this,
but my sense is this exploit is likely one
of the first major, probably is extensively
using AI as a kind of core orchestration
of the exploit itself. I have no proof of
this. This is just me guessing, but it seems
that given the timing, given the things that
I'm seeing in the space, it's, it's pretty
likely that somewhere, some group of bad guys
were probably using, you know, a lot of the
same tools that we're using to build and
create crazy things for the opposite reasons,
right? So what But we're experiencing
what's probably a sort of first step and will
likely be a really interesting few years
to come. And just as a note, yesterday, actually,
I was looking at one of my projects for a
client, and they're basically giving me
a hard time. Is this secure? Is this actually
doing what you're saying it's doing? And so
I'm like, OK, so I pointed the swarm at it
and said, look at this API endpoint, which
is actually in the development environment.
Now, it wasn't even live. And then I let it
run for a while. I went off and start talking
about other things. And then, you know, 10
minutes later, I came back to this swarm that
was basically looking at the development
environment and trying to determine whether
this thing that we had built was secure.
and one of the parts of the swarm had actually
decided without me telling it to go and
explore the sort of you know the sort of rabbit
hole where that api led to and it led to
the production site and then as part of
that process it actually mapped the entire
production environment that they had set up and
found all their exploits and it actually gone
in and took advantage of all those exploits
without me asking it and what's interesting
when you look at these tools and you
And if you were to say, go exploit ABC site,
it's going to say, no, sorry, I can't do that,
right, HAL 2000 or whatever. But the virtue
of the fact that I started with a sort of
development environment, and I said this is
an ethical sort of pen testing structure,
it seems to have, like, given it the sort of
okay to go and do all kinds of bad things.
So basically, it's a semantic description
or a sort of guide that allowed it to say,
okay, I can move beyond my own sort of
limitations and things I'm not allowed to do, which
is crazy and scary. Needless to say, I
think I might have ruined their weekend
by showing them a whole variety of
exploits. And this was in a highly regulated
space, just to add the cherry on top,
which got me thinking, it's a brave new world,
to say the least. Let me show you a few
things here that I'm working on for those who
haven't been up to the latest and greatest.
So, last week, I created this. Oh, let me
share my screen quick. I created an abstraction
layer, essentially, to Cloud Code. I
called it Cloud Flow. Notice I'm version 72. That's because I
wasn't paying attention at one point, and it did
20 freaking versions. where I decided
to publish each incremental change as a
version update to NPM, that's another side
effect of these swarms is because
I'm spotting, in this case,
sometimes 50 concurrent agents to do
things all at once, you've got this sort
of different... It's hard to guide it. Well,
not hard to guide it. Sometimes it's hard
to see what's actually happening within the
structure of each one of the swarm elements.
When I'm doing concurrent development like
RueCode or Cursor and those types of sort of
sequential development, I'm able to see generally
what's happening because it's doing
this, then it's moving to the next thing.
Maybe it's spawning a subtask, but I've got
the ability to really understand kind of
what's happening because it's sequential or at
least it's a single thread. Where when I start
implementing these swarms, there's the, you
know, especially when I do large swarms,
like this idea of a 50 -agent swarm, it's hard
to know that, you know, agent number 33 has
decided to go rogue. So, the one thing
that I've learned, I think, this week
is certain tasks are better suited
for this type of environment. So,
early development or complex, so complex
development is actually really good,
too. For example, earlier this week,
a storage company hired me for literally
an hour because I do a lot of these
kind of hour projects. And they're like, we
have this old school storage system was
literally built in PHP, which was interesting.
And as you guys probably know, I'm
not a huge fan of PHP, nothing against
Drupal. They still hate me for porting it
to JavaScript. But nonetheless, I pointed
that system at legacy code. We're talking
probably around 50,000 lines of code,
so a decent amount of code and
significant amounts of technical depth. And
I pointed and said, basically, rebuild
this for me using Rust. And their latency in
PHP was high. Obviously, it's PHP. It's not
great. So they were looking around 300
milliseconds for a request. And I managed to
get that down within an hour to less than
two milliseconds using a Rust-based full
implementation of their legacy system, which
basically means that it would use the same
API and SDK sort of structure. So anyone
that had previously deployed it would just
kind of magically work. That literally took
an hour. So I started looking at, like,
what kind of output can I do in this
timeframe? And then I discovered a tool
that allows me to sort of measure some
of this stuff. so there's a tool that
i found earlier that that allows me to sort
of look at my clod token monitor and
which is interesting and it tells me
things like burn rates this this it always
says tokens exceeded max limit i i obviously
am not exceeding the limit so ignore that
but what's interesting is i think this is
pretty accurate in terms of of you know what i'm
doing so in this case i did uh 272 000 tokens
and three this is a little project i
was working on earlier basically it was a uh
trading system that i was i was building but
it was i i was i was curious about sort of
how it was uh you know working let me get
some uh quickly clacks here i'm just kidding
you guys all right sorry i'm muting everyone all
right so um so what's interesting is is i i
did some benchmarking to sort of see like
what's the most i can possibly crank out in
in the run of an hour so i i was comfortably
i'm able to comfortably do around 500,000
lines of code in an hour. And then I say
500,000 lines of code, 500,000 lines of
usable code, not just garbage spaghetti
that doesn't work, but usable functional code
that passes tests. That is an incredible
amount of information. I mean, you think
about 500,000 lines. Let's put that in
the context for a moment. According to
developer guides and stuff, and regardless,
list, they're saying that the average
developer puts up somewhere between 20
lines of code a day as a professional
developer. So let's crank it up. Let's say that
now with Copilot, you're doing 50 or
100 lines of code. That means 500,000, I
don't even know what the exact number is,
but it's orders of magnitude more than
the typical developer could do in a day
we're doing in an hour. This is like, in some
ways, probably 10 years of work that
we're cranking out in an hour and using
form-based approaches. And this is all
for 200 bucks. Now, a couple of
things to note. For those that are
interested, I'm just going to do a quick
crash course again for those that don't want
to know. So there's the, you have to,
to get it installed, what, there's a
repo I created. Let me just jump to that
repo quick. Oops, it's going to let
me do that. Yeah. So Cloud Code Flow,
I created Cloud Test. Cloud Test, this gives
you the quick sort of step-by-step step
on what you need to do so this is just a
little repo i set up to to test my my stuff
when i start so you've got to install the
cloud code now there's an important part of
the process that people seem to get stuck on
when they're using this for the first
time and that is the dangerously allow um
i've already run this so i'm not you're not going
to be able to see it but there's a command
before you run cloud code you need to go
in here and run the help command so you've
already installed it and you're going to
help you need to go here and run the dangerously
allow if you don't do that you're going
to get an error and i just i probably can
figure out a way to get to to make that
error not happen but basically it's it's
basically not allowing you to run dangerously
mode until you sort of there's this like ui
interface that says are you sure you want
to run dangerously allow well obviously i'm
sure i'm putting in the freaking tag here
but anyway it It asks you again, and if you
don't do this right off the start, so Claude
dangerously allow. And the other thing
you want to do, if you ever are running a
swarm and you go to bed and it stops at two o
'clock in the morning or whatever, and you
want to resume where it left off, you can also
add the dash C, and that allows you to
continue where you left off. So it basically
invokes the previous session. So this is
a particularly useful component. you can see
here that it's continuing it says here that
i've i had an api error i need to to
implement so let's let's go ahead and let's do
that so now i have i've got i see that there's
it's it's created my test infrastructure
it's created a new collection it's testing
it's doing my market information and it's
doing integration so this is a um a trading
algorithm i won't go into details because
you know i probably shouldn't be showing this
but anyway what we're going to go here and
i'm going to quickly create a swarm create
a five agent swarm and by the way i can
also do this by and oops let's i can do slash
you can see that i've got different options
i've added here but i'm i'm not going to
bother with those right now because i'm just
going to do something And we create a five
-agent swarm using batch tool. Now, the
other interesting thing, so the way I
can create these agents is using
batch tool. All references to
batch tool have been removed from the cloud
code documentation. I looked yesterday,
I couldn't find it anywhere. So I'm hoping
they don't remove it completely from the
tool because that would suck because I'm
really enjoying these swarms. But the batch
tool feature is the secret sauce to making
these swarms work. Basically, it allows
you to create multiple instances and have
them run in parallel. So if you want
to invoke a swarm, really all
you need to do is tell it to
use batch tool. Now, in this case,
I'm saying create a five-agent swarm using
batch tool to fix, and I'm just going
to grab this here, fix this. All right. Hey, on that, Ruben, And
on that, I did a bunch of testing yesterday
and yeah, all the documentation is definitely
gone. I couldn't find it like you, but I
tested Claude Code and it's still in the, the
tool's still there. You can't see it, but you can actually
reference it. Yeah. So that's exactly
what I'm, like, it's exactly what
I'm doing right now. So, so now you see
here, it says swarming. I love that. And so, and I've got my
thinking mode enabled. The thinking mode
I've set to 20,000 tokens. that seems to
be about right and it allows it to ponder a
little longer it works really well you can
you can also tell it to think harder or do
like ultra thinking and it thinks forever
depending on what the problem you're trying
to solve you might want to get it to ponder a
little longer i like that that sounds like
a poem but the the key when you want to
ponder longer you might use it for certain
things like algorithms you might want to
design or or solving really hard problems
now you see the reason i know it's working you
can see each of these tasks is being spawned
independently now if all's well we we
should see five uh five units whoa i'm not sure
where that came from but um so now we've
got one two three four five and i'm not sure
what the blue thing on my screen i'm seeing
is but uh hey chris wait how's it going
good welcome back um All right, so now
when you spawn large swarms, you're going
to see this. And this happens because I've
continued a previous setup, and it's going
to flicker for a bit. This generally goes
away, and it doesn't mean it's not
working. It's a little aggravating, and this
is back to the thing I was telling you
about where you can't actually see what's
happening particularly well. Now, I've got
a status mode here. I'm going to jump through this one for a sec. um any idea how
i clean that blue thing off my screen
this is a first my chris voice put it on there chris are
you guys that i i am either the
ones to see that no no no it's okay
yeah we all anyway it's okay well didn't know
the blue line i'm not sure what that is but
anyway there's also a so to to give a little
bit of introspection what i've done is I'm
still working on this is a work in progress
for anyone and you cloud flow and you can
do help and in this case we can if we we
see how we get different options we've got the
ability to look at you know various statuses
so we can go to the memory memory and
then we we can see the various queries we can
we can do lists and this gift this will help
you sort of get an idea of what's happening
i've also got this for agents and tags and
types so in this case oh i didn't do memory
let's do let's go back let's do memory memory
so this is showing all the different
things so what i'm and this and my memory
system is is actually the most rudimentary memory
system i could possibly invent there's no
vectors there's no well i've got an option for
sqlite but generally it's just it's just
json and of all the things i tried the json
structure was actually the best it worked
it was simple it was easy it allowed it
allows the system to sort of understand what
what's happening oh it looks like i my swarm
crashed my instance let's go back here and see
what's happening and all right do you
have the orchestrator running in one of the
terminals yes it's running right here so this is
you can see it running this is the system
the the system invokes the orchestrator itself
as part so the so clod code invokes the
orchestrator and the memory so you don't go
clod clod flow start yeah okay got it yeah
exactly exactly and i guess i i apologize
guys i have no idea how to get rid of this
blue line which is is a little strange um all
right guys ruben uh yeah in your cloud test
repository you laid out the four steps right
just so that all of us understand i think
there's a bit of variance here so first
step is cloud code install which we understand
obviously cloud flow your reinstall but in
order to get started did you you said you have
to invoke a dangerously dangerous permissions
do you do that from cloud code for
quote yes i do and and i think what i'm going
to do i'm going to i'm going to just update
this quickly so errol let's let's do it real
time it's just a command line option it's just
a command yeah it's a command line option
right so here so the problem is run
cloud flow start the orchestrator so what i
need to do is i need to add another step step four
we'll make oops step four and what this
what we need to do here is we need to do clog
and then we need to do uh what i think i
have this in my memory so let's grab that game
run dangerously this one yeah and and then
i then what you need to do is you need to
accept the UI warning message, then you can
run the orchestrator. And again, the problem
I'm running into is I'm like kind of
working between both. So it's a little bit,
sometimes I skip a step here or there.
Oh, I don't like the way that looks. I'm
going to fix that too. Let's add some
brackets around that. And once you start
orchestrator, does it invoke
Spark under the hood anyway, basically the
Spark methodology? Yes. That's step
number five. Yeah. And the other thing
that I've been working, and the other thing
we can do here, which is kind of cool, and
I'll push this out sometime this weekend or
maybe early next week. I've also integrated
the MCP feature. so we can go in here and now
we've got clod flow mcp if you want to
integrate it with like cursor or whatever and
so you can invoke the different get cursor
to do it for you and the other interesting
feature is you can use the clod code system
as the mcp itself as well which is kind of
a fun little way to interact with it and
if you're interested in doing that all you need
to do is do clod mcp serve and then you
can do ports and stuff like that but if you
do i think by default i think it runs in
studio and then you do that and now you're
running the clod mcp server mcp server
which you get clod code to use clod
code mcp directly in itself which is kind
of cool and uh to see that i'm running i'm
doing some work here on the mcp but i'm
gonna show you that quick so in clod i'm
not i'm not running with dangerous at the
moment but i'm just going to show you
what that looks like. It's kind of like
a recursive system. All right, so now
we're here. Now when you have
MCPs, you can go here and you can
do MCP, and then you can see you
have a Cloudflow. I haven't published
this yet, so you'll have to use my dev version,
but in this case, I'm going here. Then I
can view tools. I can see all my different
modes, and each of these modes can then be
invoked directly within the sort of swarm
itself so you can do swarm it's like i don't
know what i call it like subtasks within
the swarm it's kind of and so the so the
additional the addition of mcps within the swarm
really kicks up the the capabilities and
and back to my original comment about you know
hacking and exploitation that is the part
that's most worrisome Because you can
create the swarm that invokes various CLIs and
MCPs, and then you've got the sort of –
you're the master of the universe at that point.
It can do anything, anywhere. Hey, on that,
Ruben, so you only run one instance of
Claude code as an MCP? No, I run it – each
instance uses its own MCP. It's magic.
I'm not sure how exactly it figures
out, but it just works. Does that option runs CloudCode as
an MCP server? Yeah, it runs
CloudCode as an – oh, here's
interesting. My swarm just crashed
my instance. So this happens.
Oh, it looks like it finished anyway. But
here, this is how you recover from a
crashed instance, if you guys are running
too many VS codes. Yeah, so this is going
to happen. And this is probably a byproduct
of the fact that I'm trying, this is a
trading algorithm I'm building, which is
probably just putting a lot of CPU stress on it.
I probably need to switch at this point
from a swarm based implementation to a
sequential implementation. So there's two issues I
have. I'm probably just using a code space that
doesn't have enough RAM, most likely.
But when this does happen, I'll show you
exactly how to recover from it. So it's not
a big deal. And I'm to add better recovery
tools as well here but i got too much stuff
on my plate all right hopefully it comes back
to life here in a sec because this this is
uh here we go okay all right give it one more
second there's a as i said the dash c
command is the part that essentially allows you
to recover so you're going to do clod dash
c and then i'm going to grab that dangerously
overly complicated command. And then I'm just going to do that. And that allows you
to recover. There's also a session ID that
I might start using as part of the
memory. I haven't actually included that
in my memory. That allows you to have
multiple sessions and remember. So if you're
running multiple terminals, you can do
that. All right. So that looks like it
actually didn't quite finish. So I'll just
type in continue. And it'll continue
where it left left off nice room quick
question for you and i've noticed you
know you kind of go for fives like fives
five or 50 like like how do you decide
on how many agents or how yeah how
many like how many unique agents you want
to have going in a swarm like i put in five
and seen what happened like yeah i did of
course of course i did of course i know
yeah it crashed badly um it got to it got to
about 150 and everything sort of stopped. But
so it did attempt. I think I know how to
do 5,000. I would have to have multiple
$200, you know, Claude Max accounts. And then
what I would do is use Tmux, whatever, how
do you pronounce that? And then I'd create
multiple instances, probably a VS Code Swarm.
If you guys remember that VS Code Swarm
system I built a couple months ago and then
i'd have multiple vs code instances or multiple
terminals or multiple containers running and
then i'd orchestrate all of them i totally
want to do like the guinness book of
world records for swarms yeah no i i don't want
to i don't want to i don't want to spend
like two hundred dollars times five or
whatever or times a hundred but yeah it's totally
it's totally doable the other thing and
all of them building guardrails well they're
going to be taking over the web. The
other thing you should note, the reason I did
five and not 10 or 20, five seems like all my
tests, it's the optimal amount of agents that
balances not maxing out my account so
I can actually have multiple projects running
concurrently. So this trading system I was
showing you and other projects I'm working
on. And I also saw, I saw a little improvement
going beyond five, like in certain things,
like if I was doing like a GPU cluster or
something, having 20 concurrent agents
orchestrating like my hugging face in a
cluster probably would be okay but for most things
i saw zero improvement using 10 versus using
five so i'm like all right i'm i'm gonna
make five the default because most people
have no idea and i just make it easy for
you that was my entire entire thing how do
you measure improvement you say so is it just
subjective or you have some kind the metric
i've met i get benchmarks so i was it
last month i can't remember but i i integrated
the swe bench tool that basically is a
tool that allows you to measure the performance
of the software engineering agents and
then i then i used the swarm against that
agent and i by the way i got 100 on that swe
bench i didn't fail once so it's and and then
what i did is i said how many of these can
i do concurrently and then i just kicked it
up a notch you know and i started doing 50
or whatever and then i tried to do like 5
000 and it's funny you know alex's point i
do seem to like fives but um yeah and the
other interesting thing 100 100 completion
on swe bench it never failed once nice i'm
gonna take us to the speaker component their
guest component roof um let me see if
that's uh if that's good that's good
let's go all right all right so uh first
off we got ****** ****** v3 and the
new york city crew are with us hey ******
hey jad hey guys you're on mute there hey what's up
everybody can you see us all in the
awesome room that Zohar provided us
with at Kaltura. There we go. Wood paneling.
This is Andy Warhol's original
workshop. Wow. Right? So we're here
making some art. All right? So a couple of
weeks ago. Oh, guys, this is the first time
we've all gathered in person, too.
This is our first planning meeting.
If we can get a little hurrah.
I know we're all developers and
introverted and stuff but gotta get one of these
uh posters yeah yeah right so so we're pretty
excited here we're gonna get together
and plan our first event and uh hopefully
get some some good turnout here in new york
so um so that's that for my demo guys a
couple of weeks ago uh you all saw me share
a um prototype really a terminal-based
application that was uh you know hooked up
and running and you know writing midi code
and running it through like these like old
like files and stuff like sf2 files and
like pretty cool stuff um but i did a little
bit more exploring and i found this library
called sonic pi um and there's a whole
bunch of other libraries too um but some
people told me about sonic i forget how i
heard about it but um anyway so i landed on
sonic pi and it ended up being really cool
so i uh made this awesome little app that
you have to download sonic piper so if
anybody's gone on sonic pi composer.com and
tried to use it it doesn't work you only
have to run i just made that website
because i was like having fun and i tried to
reach out to the guy but he never responded
so whatever um i hope he's a cool guy
if anybody knows him you should hook me
up sam or something like that um so anyways
let's uh hear the first thing i hope
i'm sharing sound oh i'm probably not hold
on um let's do this Yeah, can we
hit this one? Because I'm going to
have to play audio. That works. Well, it's either echo or
nothing, I guess. you know we
you know i love feedback loops right yeah and you can share
and you can share with audio i think
in in zoom and by the way we're looking
to move away from zoom probably next
month or so to some other river
riverside or something like that yeah that
should be great robert you're not
in a car that's great to see you
know home base oh did we lose the
audio i i kind of like watching these guys
moving the camera around yeah there was a
friend of mine attended a lecture at uh you
know online at uh berkeley and uh in the
first hour of the three -hour event was a
fellow staring into his laptop trying to fix
the audio like infamous that's art yeah yeah
it's like in our events in london we
have never managed to a second event i think
we've got lucky this time we got a recording
but we never seem to get the sound right
on our live casting yeah yeah you know you
know a little background you know guy beaver
who's on this call he and i we used to
work at the citrix uh R&D Lab to do video
conferencing for their various web
conferencing technologies and we spent many a
day trying to figure out that problem
but we never solved it but it was fun
to be in the R&D Lab Is this looking
like this one's going to go here
William? We can come back too
****** after the it's it's the demo gods which greek
god is the god of demos i i
don't even know it's probably demolus
yeah demolus it'll be low key the god
of mischief yeah i i was going for
like rome or roman or greek but uh
norse also works yeah yeah all righty guys
well we'll come back at the end at the
open open session will it be three we're
looking forward to to hearing the music
once you're once you're good to go um
let me see so oh we got a quick update from
uh mondweep and bents they had an uh just
a wonderful week out in london uh rocky
um isaac uh chris poulter mark d um that
uh an event there at Greenwich University,
an important panel, and then their
hackathon, too. So I'd love to hear the
update, Manduit, Benson. Yeah, sure. We
basically had, we were invited
to an event that was going
on for the week. On Wednesday, we kind
of had a small panel, mainly our group,
basically, with Rodrigo, who was organizing
it, and some of the members from the
university. So it's a general discussion,
more like introduction about our experiences,
how we got involved in Agentix and the general
potential of it. Then we opened
up a hackathon, which we had
prepared for. There were focused
participation, I think not as much as we'd
have hoped for. I think it was a different
stage and event compared to the previous one,
which was at Google. and today we kind of
again had a much more closed view where we
had some demos back from some of the couple
of the participants about work they had
attempted using the frameworks and then we
did a workshop of broadly very basic uh starting
with basic of spark original spark to
like bits of the swarm architecture um we
we also were not the demo gods went very
favorable to us because we did it remote today
but that is a summary but Benz please add if
I have missed anything please yeah the learning
is that we don't we shouldn't use
Microsoft Teams on live stream events because
it carries the GPU completely but yeah it
was great and people telling us you know
the demand for learning and agentics is
incredible there was a A friend of mine from
New York even was connecting live the live
stream and she didn't know that agent exists
and now she's planning to join every Friday.
So even if it's local, then it can have
an effect globally. And we intend to
actually follow through in the post-event
setup. So we would be following through with
the university faculty to see what we can
actually do tangibly based on this experience.
So that is the main thing that we are
actually aiming for. Thank you. There's several other
universities that are interested in
collaborating, European universities that are
interested in collaborating with you. I'm going
to introduce you to. I had a call this
morning. I'm not sure if he's on this call
or not, but with a university out of Heidelberg,
Germany, and they're looking to do something
to collaborate. So I told them
about you and some of the folks like
Vincent in France. lots of collaboration
opportunities please do dangerous
thanks cool it's i always find
funny just uh that you know people haven't
haven't heard of agentics yet maybe
because i i spend my days doing nothing but
talking about it but it's we're we're in
early early days like it's it's it's it's
barely a thing um it's it's a thing to
us i guess but it's 99% of the world has
never heard of it. Incredible. And when is the next London event,
do you think? We are planning
one in July. Yeah, amazing. Monvick, you have a info? Yeah, I mean, we may have we don't know the
dates, but there is another one. This one
is more firm that Ben was talking about,
but we are planning one with LBS probably
late July or August. there's one yeah
because the shashi uh wanted to join
the agent dc has a london ai meetup
group with 150 people and he's keen
on to merge with us let's do it
wonderful let's do it fantastic chat here
just just uh since we're on the topic um
if you are looking to host an event in your
city, you can sign up to be an ambassador
on agentics.org slash ambassador. So
I just put the link in the chat. You might
have to scroll up a tiny bit there. So
if you think that you or somebody you might
know wants to host an event, we're here to
help support that. You can message me
directly too on Discord, but we have events
popping up all over the world and just
want to make sure you all have that link.
So you do have to become an ambassador
in order to kind of get the the support that
we have here as an organization so sign
up there and we will process you and make
sure that you have everything all right
amazing and remind us how do you become an
ambassador so that yeah alex um i'll just
speak to that quick so that process you
fill out the form and then uh we'll have a
chance to uh meet we'll get on a zoom call
get a sense of your background you know
if you if you've done any event management
before what your thoughts are and then everything
looks like it's in sync you hold your
first event and if that all goes well
everybody's thrilled and happy then uh
then there's a chapter formation and then um
yeah and then it's off and running so that's
sort of the process perfect appreciate
that uh vincent you've got a paris event on
monday it was the last second thing kelsey's
in town anything you want to say about
paris uh the keyword is uh agility because we
we learned yesterday that the event was on
monday and luckily we have a very nice host
uh it's a guy who is famous for organizing
a very large event in corsica the rock festival
he has a nightclub he has a rooftop
rooftop uh space in in the heart of paris so
depending on how many people join because
it's last minute we may go for the the rooftop
25 otherwise it's going to be up to 200
people uh and i'm also activating my network
there so let's see but uh it's going to
be a mix it's not going to be uh coding it's
going to be kelsey uh doing some form of a
keynote on what she did with ai so far and
her job with coke coca -cola she's the mastermind
between uh behind the the coke campaigns
you know and i'm gonna do uh i'm gonna
uh i'm gonna show i'm gonna to build stuff.
I'm going to have about 20 minutes, 30
minutes, and I'm going to kind of reverse
engineer, you know, what they see and how this
happens, right? So a little bit like a light
touch roof session. And then we have
champagne, of course, because
it's Paris, right? In the summer. Yeah. That's the idea. And last update before
we do a next little presentation here. On
Tuesday in Toronto, it's Toronto Tech
Week. We've got 300 and something people signed
up and i think we only have space for 60
so we'll see how that goes um and so that
that's gonna if you're in toronto and you
just ping me or rob or brad or anyone in in
toronto and we'll make sure that you you get
you're in just show up early and help us
set up um but it's going to be it's going
to be crazy so that's on tuesday i think 5
30 that's right 5 30 to 8 30 and rube i
think there's like 128 people on the waiting
list plus the 200 cops so that's that 338
you're talking about it's growing by the
hour. So yeah, it's going to be a, it's going
to be a lot of fun. And this is John
Messing. I just want to let you
know for Vincent, my son who lives
in Paris and a fellow colleague
are going to show up for the
event on Monday. Excellent. That's three
of us now. Perfect. Bring it more,
bring more. And, and John,
welcome. I know you're, you're, you're,
you're our old school sort of programmer
and love that you're joining us. Thanks
for coming on today. All right. Rob, who's next? So next, we've got
Miko Alessarela, and I'm really excited
to hear about these projects. So Miko's,
this startup is with the previous CIO of
Finland's government infrastructure, and
they're working to prepare the nation for
the arrival of AGI. You know, Finland
seems to get it. They seem to get
everything right. So I'm really looking
forward to it. Miko, thank you.
Thank you for sharing. Yeah. Can you see
my presentation? Yep. Can we see Slack
or something? Are you presenting
your WhatsApp? WhatsApp, yeah. Oh, I'm sharing
the wrong screen. Let me try to find the
right one from here. So, you now see the right one? That'll build an AI
native public sector. Okay, cool. Okay, let me
do this quick. So, yeah, so this
company is basically technically started
at the beginning of this month, but it
went to the register in Finland in April, and
then we got all the paperwork and
everything ready in May. So, I'll tell the
story on what we do. So this starts
from my history. Of course, I have almost
20 years in AI, having founded
companies in Silicon Valley in Berlin,
Germany, and also here in Finland
over the years. So I got concerned
about this lack of understanding
in public sector on this massive
transition to AGI. It will probably
change everything in terms of how
governments are funded, how things are run
in societies. and now that we basically,
I mean of course our group here
understands that this HGI is imminent but the
general population is still like a
myth so I show these government, how to say leaders in the
country that this HGI will
change everything and in order for
us to be able to preserve our
welfare society which basically has
yielded the happiest nation on earth for 8
years in a row So we will have to jump onto this
bandwagon and implement everything to be
ready for this change. So I'll explain
to them that AI is already able
to do everything. It's able to use tools.
It's able to memorize everything. And the
only thing missing from it to be generally
capable of doing almost anything that
we can imagine is that it doesn't yet have
a world model, which probably will emerge
over the next 18 months. And this has caused
the internet to basically be filled
with AI content. It was 57% at the
beginning of last year already. It's
now probably available over 70% or maybe
80%. It's going to be 90% by the
beginning of 2026. It also means
that the bot traffic on the
internet has surpassed human
traffic last year. In Western Europe,
it's currently over 70%,
according to stats. Majority of this traffic, unfortunately,
is malicious. So we literally have
a bot fest going on in the internet
on a daily basis. And now these
are the two most important slides
of my presentation. So in today's world,
like most people still don't use AI to perform
their daily work. They only occasionally
use it for some tasks. And majority of those
who are using AI are using it as a
tool, which means that they can achieve some
kind of incremental improvement to
their productivity. There's a small
group of partners that are able to
more than double their productivity
with AI agents. And then there's us who
are basically pushing the boundaries on
the world scale. And in order for us to really
compete and in order for us to really build
a society and any organization should
be looking like this, everybody should be at
2x or more productivity levels. And on the
top end, it should be the next plus. And if
this shift happens, I think these companies
and organizations, whether it be
private or public sector, will be
able to compete. And my argument in my
country is also that if we do this, it's
literally the silver bullet to make a
massive jump on the productivity, then turn
it into GDP growth. And so it's
imperative for the whole country
to do this. And in order for you
to achieve this, you have to understand that
this is not a tool. Every time people say
that AI is a tool, I say that you are
looking for incremental improvements, not
transformative changes. You have to
understand that agents can do everything. And I also tell
the public sector that they can
actually automate the whole decision
-making process. There's an insane
number of different processes going on in
the government, like issuing permits,
registering companies. issuing social
security payments, doing all kinds
of things that are currently
done by humans. And I said that you
can automate it all with AI because these
things are based on rules and laws and
regulations. The only thing you do is that
you start in a step -by-step plan to go
towards AI-driven decision-making. And
this could yield like, for example,
organizations like the Social Security
Administration to basically make decisions on
the social security payments in minutes
rather than in days or in weeks that they're
currently doing. So I'm also telling,
this is very important in Nordics, you
tell that you're jumping into this AI
band, but it actually reduces your stress,
it doesn't increase it because you are
delegating work to agents to focus on
the important tasks. And this is an
important message because people
always see that, hey, I need to double
my productivity, I need to triple
my productivity. It means that I have
no free time, I'm going to be stressed every
day and so on. So I'm just telling them the
story that it doesn't mean for the human
workers any added stress necessarily. It means
that they're adapting AI to get all the
stressful tasks done. And I'm also telling
them if we are able to basically
get our citizens into this like
multiplier trajectory that I showed in
the previous slides, we will have AI
capable citizens and AI in the public
sector. We can compete and we can survive
this. I'm also having like a lot of
technical stuff that I don't have time
to go into, like how we are building
this infrastructure. But yeah, that's in short what we are building. We started at the
beginning of June with the company.
We already have one multiple, and this
is the fun part, definitely fun
for Ruv to hear, is that we've won
multiple very important government bids
on building AI infrastructure for
them through doing this AI-native transformation
against very large companies as a
two-person startup. This is very
important because the government guys
understood that these guys who have done over
100 AI projects in the past combined with
an army of agencies is probably better
for them than having 1,000 employees in
an organization. okay mika you gotta
meet my favorite my favorite fin is a
guy named martin mikos he's uh oh yeah
i know i know him very well yeah oh
okay yeah he he you should talk to him
he'd be all over this if you don't know him
i can intro yeah you know you know he knows
me well as well so i okay yeah i mean i
will definitely have a discussion now that
you mentioned it like like if he's working
on this field yeah he's he's he's really into
this stuff right now so and he was i think
he was the CEO at HackerOne. I might still
be there. I don't know. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I
think he quit as a CEO. So, but yeah, he's
another consul of Finland in the Bay
Area. I actually hanged out with him
quite a few times when I was living
in the Bay Area. So, yeah, really nice guy. Cool. This is, this
is, so a couple of comments, you know,
there's inevitably every agentic
conversation ends with, you know, AGI, ASI,
or some sort of, you know, singularity
conversation. And, you know, the idea
of AGI is this kind of all knowing, all
encompassing AI that can solve all problems.
And in my opinion, that isn't going to happen
from a statically defined language model
that sort of, you know, is responsive, right?
And the challenges that we have is this
perception that a lot of these models are sort
of you know inherently smart right and can
do and act and they none of these things
as we know from agentic as being agentic
engineers that requires guidance like whether
it's a swarm you know operational source
constructs i think that the the building blocks for
agi will emerge from the tools like the swarm
components you were you were seeing
earlier and how we sort of orchestrate and and
use those in a kind of feedback you know a
perpetual feedback probably you know what
what are you thinking what are you thinking in
regards to like what AGI even looks like when
when you're describing this to a government
or an organization well I mean uh from my
perspective AGI like how I explain it to
them is uh it's not like uh explaining like
artificial consciousness or anything like
this it's a simply uh saying that AI can do
anything that we can do and you know and and
that's it like uh be it like a swarm of
agents or be it like some kind of like a
combination of tools and others uh the thing is
that the fact what what you guys are achieving
already and i'm also achieving similar
things now uh uh is is that that it's a
testament of this aga happening like like
literally uh we can multiply i mean rube you have
showed like multiple times like how many
people's work and we can now do with ai i
mean that's literally explaining how the ag
is emerging uh so it's yeah mikko you know
public sector is great but i think one of the
underserved areas is the smb sector because
the problem with smb is they don't have
enough money they don't they don't like now
i'm helping one of the smbs but neither none
of the big players really want to speak
directly to them so they are true resellers and
others right but they are the backbone of the
economy to be honest i think there is a
huge opportunity to actually engage and
them better to something seminar I think yeah so the funny thing is that
a lot of the problems for small entrepreneurs
is coming from like all the obstacles
and government practices and other things
that are making their lives hard like in
unnecessarily difficult ways I'm actually working
on multiple initiatives already with the
government that are making it easier to
be an entrepreneur in this country you know
so I mean a simple thing like for example
automating the process of registering a company
or doing filings and other things like
completely for some reason we do have some parts
of the government that are completely
automated one is taxation I guess like anything
that makes money for the government is
instantly automated because it makes money
faster for them but you know when it comes
to like supporting entrepreneurs uh we
have a filing time for a company um it's like
about three to four weeks uh like you file a
company you get get it registered in three
to four weeks and it costs like 370 euros
to do do like a limited company and then estonia
does the same thing in one day and 50 bucks
uh so i mean i see i see a lot of room
for improvement and the same thing is is true
with that with all the accounting uh which
is a small business benefiting thing like
what if what But if all the accounting was
basically trivial or free for most of the
entrepreneurs, it would take a lot of burden
out of the next. And, you know, and so that
would be also helpful for for the
entrepreneurship in general. In Canada, we are
equivalent, I think, is building permits
and the ability to actually build a
house without getting crushed by massive,
long and expensive processes. Miko, I
love that Finland has never wavered
from the concept of the requirement of
a social safety net. So I think you
guys are in an incredible position
to really illustrate around the world
what it means to prepare for the
arrival of AGI, considering that
definition, that it's capable of doing
the vast majority or all economically
meaningful work. Are you optimistic
that the public sector is going to
become AI native? Yeah, I mean, lots of
people were skeptical when I started this.
Like, they said that this is an impossible
task. Like, you can't convince these
******** to do anything meaningful. But at the
end of the day, what happened was that we
happened to have, like, a perfect combination.
Like, I'm very well known in Finland
myself as an AI hacker. And then my co
-father, Janne, he's basically one of
the most well-known public servants of
the country, like before he started
doing this with me. So now having this
kind of star power that we have in the country,
it's much easier for us to negotiate with
the public sector decision makers. but but
also uh it requires them to learn that that uh
it's actually better to buy from a nimble
nimble company that it has a lot of ai like
and behaves in an ai native way than uh
doing like this massive contracts with large
corporations with thousands of employees because
they will take years and they will cost
millions or tens of millions and and they
will usually get nothing useful eventually for
the government uh that's a simply ways of
extracting money from the government So our
philosophy of doing this transformation is
important here as well. Miko, you're on the
right path because I just saw a reel
not too long ago that London,
England is actually, Robert, using AI to
scan all the documents specifically for
building permits. Because they've got
surveys in boxes that if you file something,
it's like there's a water main that
was laid 300 years ago. So they've got
all the boundaries and all the registrations.
So apparently London, England is
already doing this. And also here
in Canada, Miko, IRAP, so the Industry
Research Association, they've got like a
couple of mega funds. And one of them
specifically, they repeatedly have going is the
adoption of AI for SMBs. So they'll create a
fund and then they create incentives for
consultants to actually help them um adopt ai
so there are initiatives here in canada that
would actually dovetail to what you're doing
so yeah yeah i mean i i'm i'm hoping i'm
hoping that we can like export happiness
uh to the world like uh the happiness is part
of the part of the thing that and i think
finns are famous for that uh like this for
some reason win this like world happiness
ranking every year like past eight years and
i think it's partially because because like
we learned to be content and you know and
this kind of contentment and because everybody's
taken care of like like it leads into
this kind of contentment and and and mental
safety so uh if we have ai and let's say
that we managed to build this nordic welfare
society model with ai and we can export it
to everything then we have basically all the
government services available for technically
free with no tax money needed uh for
everybody everywhere and i think that's
something that we should do uh i mean uh if we
care about humans like like i think that's
the right thing to do hey miko i have a quick
question for you um what do you feel like
agentics foundation could do to help support
that initiative or what you're working on
other than obviously like kind of having a
platform to speak is there anything that you
would wish that we as an organization would
be able to do to help support someone like
you in your position uh yeah i i'd be i'd be
discussing actually we actually have members
from the like some of the government uh and
this in thinland here also in the agentics
already uh i think there's a demo from
citra here on basically listening to us right
now um and and uh uh we uh like like we've been
discussing with them that that we could
basically put together the two of us like some
kind of agentics, like local entity that helps
do this one thing, which I have in this
curve, which is like helping the citizens
become more AI capable. And this is like a
very important part of this educational
aspect, like how do you make people
more AI capable? So this part, I think
agentics can help a lot with. i think uh
uh right now uh of course we are kind of
like a group of hackers who are pushing the
boundaries and so i think there's a lot
of engineers who have very let's say high
iq and high technical capabilities uh but
how do we help like this to be spreading
like large like to the society at large you
know and you know help everybody to be more
on the bandwagon that's a question that i
don't have an answer to yet but uh i think
there's some kind of trickle down effect
that they can probably induce all right well
we're we're at the top of the hour which means
we're going into our after hour show where
we lose some of our participants really
appreciate you taking the time to show us and
tell us about what you're working on love
love to see love what what you're doing i
have a whole variety of questions around ubi
as well which i'm sure is probably a hot topic
as well and i think the takeaway here is
is um socialism isn't necessarily a dirty
word that you know we sometimes are kind of
conditioned to think that the only economic
model is is pure unadulterated capitalism
not that i'm trying to sound like a communist
or anything crazy but the i think we need to
think about the future where we work in
partnership with ai and and i guess that opens
the question is what in the world does does
work even look like when ai is better at
most knowledge working jobs not that i haven't
answered that but but but i i don't
think this is like like from my perspective like
this is not socialism it's basically like
uh caring about others and building an
infrastructure for helping people and you know
and if you do it with ai then we don't
have to have so high taxes either because
because like uh the tax money is trying to fund
this kind of system but if you have AI
to do it, like it's probably like much lower
cost for us to run. So from my point of
view, it seems to me that AI represents a lot
fewer people generating a lot more wealth.
And the issue then is how does the excess
wealth get distributed? Do we have things like
minimal income and everybody benefits or
does it go into the hands of a few and we get a
a ruler-based society and and that to me
is the bottom line in all of this uh i i my
my story includes one slide like i didn't have
time to show here but it says that if we
have uh like a gl-level technology in our hands
and we still don't have a like we don't
serve everybody in the society uh the two
things are true at the same time we have technology
that can solve all of our problems and
we are in trouble why is that like like it's
a choice that we are making like we are
making choice to be in trouble even if we don't
have to so i i'm trying to bridge this gap
bridge this gap like to to bring the technology
to solve our problems and then uh everybody
can feel more safe and cared for uh in
this environment i mean most problems are already
solvable today like this is just at another
order of magnitude right but like we could
redistribute resources in a certain way
where everyone would eat nowadays it's already
happening so i think john your point is
extremely valid um yeah and great i think it's
a powerful initiative i was just wondering
for for the initiative for like the small
business owner and maybe government supporting
the small business owners is there anything
that you you've seen works or what small
business owners or consultants or or people
are looking forward to even even get started
like just taking that first step to understand
what what the heck's going on because like
you said everyone's so busy and they don't
have the big resources like other ones is there
anything that you're seeing works or people
are interested in i guess open to
the whole group i think yeah
i'll let someone else answer it
yeah i can i can take a stab at
i mean i think obviously it's the
bandwidth and understanding that is that's the
constraint but what everyone cares about
everyone most probably have been through
a cyber incident at some point in time for
me i think the biggest entry point for
raising that awareness and effectively making
people understand adopt is through that
route effectively showing like how can we
actually like back to the point about your
ethical hacking group, I think the ability
to show that, look, you are exposed, but
we can approach it in this way. I think that
is the first step to making people realize
what is Agentex AI and why it can be bad, but how its power can be leveraged as well.
That's my, you know, two cents
perspective on this. And Ferris, that's
the entire purpose of the Agentex organization
is as a counterbalance to, I think, what
John mentioned in this consolidation of both
power information and wealth. And in
essence, I really liked the original concept
behind OpenAI circa like 10 years ago, where
they said they were going to create an
open organization dedicated to sort of
stopping a group of very wealthy, powerful
companies and individuals from basically dominating
the space ironically they became the
very thing they were founded to stop i don't
know i i don't know why that happened
but money corrupts apparently so the same
thing with google right google don't their
motto was don't be evil and now does that
mean as soon as we're successful we'll we'll
be evil like i hope not um is it is there
is it or i don't know it's like it It must
be possible to do things with some level
of altruism, isn't it? Or am I just
kidding myself? Please forgive me
for interrupting your conversation. Someone
else would be able. Please forgive me
for interrupting your conversation. I
probably should share my picture better than
I do, but I look horrible, so I would
just scare everyone. But what I think it
is, is not that the money corrupts you so
much. is the preservation of what you have
that corrupts you, so that when you have so
little, you're not that concerned with preserving
the status quo. I can only say this
because I was born in Harlem, and I remember
being a revolutionary. I was a Black
Panther. I was a Black Muslim. I was a
revolutionary. I wanted to change the system,
and all of a sudden, when i got a job
and i started making over six figures i
remember my brother telling me one day
i worked for ibm at the time my brother
told me one day he said you know
you are the man now and my politics changed
and i think what it is is that you
know when you when you have so much that's
entwined with what is the way things are
you know to you it seems the way things
are are just fine. Please forgive me
for interrupting you. No, that
makes total sense. There's a couple
terms, you know, one that came back, I
believe from the 90s, is the concept of
techno capital, that as technology speeds
up the cycle between the accumulation
of capital and the growth of the power of
the technology ultimately lead to a singularity
and um and i think collectively near
universally we want to avoid that kind of thing
the other term that it gets referenced as a
perpetual uh perpetual dictatorship because
in its darkest form because if you have
the ability of absolute artificial AGI and
or under the control of a single entity, that
becomes really scary. I love the idea. We've
got to get to the idea of there is a
form of participation, economic participation,
whether it's UBI, although I don't think
it should be basic. I think that's an
assumption we want to challenge, that there's
great plenty in our future. There can be
could be great plenty. And that so I push
back against the idea of a basic income or a
minimal participation, because the one
element I think that we sometimes miss or
doesn't weigh in is that we all contributed
to the data that allowed for science
and capital to test the hypothesis that all
you needed was scale. so all of our data went
in by permission or not right and therefore
i think data is missing from the cap
table and universally a dividend to individual
humans around the planet might be one
path that we explore and martin i think you
want to pipe in there we i think we cut
you off yeah sorry i didn't mean to in ****
like that um i'm saying that everyone
recognizes the hazard of someone else being evil
right so if you're in the community you go
oh someone here could really take all the
power but if you're the person who made it
to the top it's it's a hazard right because
you know you set a constitution like any
founder of a um like in government say oh
let's not do evil but the temptation that
once you're there is like well i'm the best
person to look after this and i think that
um you know altman and etc they they
recognize the hazards but once they're in power
they won't stay there so guys just um i can
show you something a little more altruistic
or practical so you guys know that i've
been working on varai for a while and one
of the things in terms of what mika was
talking about in terms of like how you can
use ai for social good My investor, Unity
Labs, has been pushing me. So I've actually
used the Agentec platform, and I
now have a full example of a SaaS
platform for managing an eyewear practice
because it is so horribly bad if you
are in North America. And one of the things,
if you go, I kind of feel good about this
startup because the World Health Organization
says there are 4 billion people on
the planet in need of eyewear or like eye care
in general, right? And you basically have
like the first world where we spend a lot
of money on our frames and it's covered by
insurance. And then you have like the third
world where you basically don't have opticians,
ophthalmologists, limited access
to hardware and glasses and whatever. And when companies
like Wixotica have an overrun of their frames,
they donate them out of charity. so I do
think that when it comes to things like AI
there are things like business like really
sucky things with respect to the government
that you can automate and streamline and
I think the Public Service Alliance of
Canada will like that idea but maybe they can
you know be retrained to do other things
that actually add value but on on the platform
that I just finished I now have the ability
to help optimize the practice using AI,
looking at the bookings, using the windows.
And I actually built, and I'm sharing the
wrong window, but I actually built connections
to publicly available repos for medical
research on AI. So it's like on Hugging
Face and other places. So if you're not the
Mayo Clinic, this massive organization
in the US that like has all of this control
over the market right in terms of like
research um this there's basic practice management
patient management optimization but
part of my roadmap is to say hey where are
these publicly available apis and libraries
and how can we create software to empower
diagnostics not just for the first world
but if i release the sas platform and the
data that's being trained on these ai
models around diagnosis, right, and being able
to get a diagnosis over your phone,
using AI to do different kind of
eye diagnostics, you can actually do
good in serving a specific vertical
or group that way. So I'm very
close to being able to publish this. And hopefully by
September, this launches in like North America,
but the idea is that all the intelligence
that we're building the
platform can be used in other markets
for other people. I like it. I love the concept. I have a soft spot
for trying to empower and improve the lives
of people indirectly who don't even know
this technology exists. Yeah, I was just recently
talking to a lawyer and a few medical
offices, small practices that have all this
documentation they have to manage daily.
They only have a handful of people to do this
work. One has taken on a licensed attorney
has literally taken on himself to learn
this, all this stuff that we know, and has
already made a 90% efficiency in his own,
in his own law firm. And so there are
at least four or five verticals
I could think of right now that
are old school. Manufacturing is one of them. They are
so old school. They do not want
to modernize, but yet they have
so many processes that need to
be modernized. Steel Incorporated
is one of those. They're just a behemoth
of an industry that's been around for decades
that has so many old school processes
and really needs to be brought up speed.
tools like NAN that have built-in agents and
workflows are easy for these individuals
to get up to speed on. Consultancy is where
I think it could come from, is where we can
prompt engineer them into a better workflow,
help them see how these tools can be
tied together, and set those things up and
go, here you go. Here's your custom workflow
for your company. Here's how you can
make yourself more efficient. And I'm
already seeing it here locally, just
in St. Pete, Florida. Nice. Please forgive me. I'm sorry, you were
talking, I'll listen. I'm building an
application using Claude and some of the
tools that Rue has come out with for
lawyers. I'm a retired lawyer, and I'm
probably a lot older than most of you.
I'm 82 years old. So I'm going to be
presenting that next week to about 250
lawyers. I've just about got it done in terms of
the test environment. So I'd like to show
it to you all next week or the week after,
because I think it may give some insight
from somebody who has content experience
over many years of the content area as to
what's needed because the question is
what's needed and the people who are doing
the work don't really understand what the
contribution can be and the people who have
the tools don't really understand what the
tools need to be applied to and I think we can
do a really a good job if we can understand
what we need to do to begin to open a
conversation to answer those questions
so that there's a connection between the
people who need the tool and the people who
can provide the tool. I just have to say
this very quickly, and please forgive me.
I feel like I'm the representative of the
underprivileged in the room. But again, coming
from my neighborhood where I came
from, I don't know how many of you
are aware of this thing. It's called
Make Wakanda Real. Have any of you
ever heard of that? Nope. So there's Will I Am
who's a rap singer and he has this movement
called Make Wakanda Real. So the answer to what
at least we believe needs to be done is I
don't know any of you that has ever heard of
the Rucker Tournament in New York. It's a
basketball tournament in New York that my
uncle is famous for. He started it. So what
we believe is each one teach one. And with
Make Wakanda Real, what we're trying to do is
meet people that are in underprivileged environments.
And when I speak underprivileged, I
include the people of West Virginia because
I've been to West Virginia and I thought I was
underprivileged in Harlem until I met a
white guy from West Virginia. And I realized,
oh, wow, it's not just us. There's a lot of
people that don't have the basic things they
need in our country. So what Make Wakanda
Real is trying to do is get everyone at least
interested in the basic concepts of AI. And
one methodology of doing that is there are
so many free, fundamental, introductory AI
courses that are out there that people are
not taking advantage of. Like, for instance, AI
900. You know, you can get a certification.
My dog could pass the certification, but at
least it gets you where you're intelligent
about the words that there are in AI. So I
think the start for most people is not necessarily
exposing them to tools, but exposing them
to the fundamentals. And what I've found
for my students is that when I get them that
first certification, it's like, you know,
first one's free on the streets. You know,
you get the first one and you're hooked from
that point forward. Well, I love what you
guys are saying. And just to John's earlier
comment as well, you know, if you're looking
for some peer review before you're going to
give your presentation, you want some some
insights some tweaks whatever you know our
crew are always happy to uh give us constructive
feedback um you know just shoot shoot
it to the group join our our uh martin's
done a really good job of managing that
discord for us discord .agentix.org um and dennis
uh to your point yeah we have anything we
can do to support some of your endeavors you
know the the you know the philanthropic sort
of you know elements i conceptually i i
love that idea you know let's let's use our
our newfound powers for good thank you sir
yeah it makes sense to me love that yeah so
we're running out of time here um you know
it's been it's been another crazy crazy week
they're always crazy i'm you know if if
anyone wants to present something you know
reach out to rob or the team here we we love
to see your work um our crew in new york sorry
about the presentation but if you want to
show it next week you know obviously we want
to hear your tunage um you know or if you
got it working you can type and show it now
if you if we got a couple more minutes
before i get a hop um otherwise we're in the
last moments anyway anything else anyone
wants to share or tell um make sure add your
linkedin if you haven't already at add and we
We represent ourselves with our little infinity
icon on LinkedIn. I try to like or follow
anyone I see that has that on their
posts. So it gives me a little visual indicator
that we're sharing our alignments or
feedback loops anyway. All right. Rob, is there an
official image? Oh, we use the emoji. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, we co-opted
the Infinity logo. I know
it's a little weird, but it's
good marketing. And basically
what we do is we slap that in our
little profile. So if you do
that, you can just copy and paste
that if you want. And that sort of
shows affiliation. The other thing that we do,
if you're a member of our group, even if
it's just a supporter, you can add yourself
as like, I think it's like an employee of
the organization. and then then you show
up in there and then you see what other
people are posting and it creates a nice
little kind of community element and brings awareness
to our organization yeah which is neat
on linkedin you can rearrange the order
so it's not looking like you changed you
know like you don't work at where you work
anymore you you can lower it down but it's
it's a it's a neat thing and uh yeah as
well too uh really like when john when you're
done that presentation we'd love to I'd
love to have you and hear it as well, and
you as well, Dennis, as that gets momentum. Brad, a quick
little update on membership, I guess. Is the site set to at
least test live next week? This is the new
member site, right, where we'll be able to
get all kinds of content and those free courses,
all that stuff? Yeah, I'll give a proper update next Friday. I'll remind you to
try and get on the schedule. But thanks
to all the donors so far. It's keeping
the lights on. We're going through updating
the site. We'll have a sneak peek on
Toronto Tech Week. For us, lots
of things for learning-centric events, committees, ways
to get involved. We got a whole crew
of people helping right now. So we're
looking to at least have something that we
can glance at early next week. And then
we'll be taking our time to make sure we
implement it properly. But again, thank
you to everyone that keeps the lights on.
And everyone that's a member right now
will be migrating you over to the latest
and greatest. And hopefully lots of
things are for you. Is there a
governance section of people who are interested
in foundational documents? because
in U.S. law, if you're a non-profit,
people who give you money can get
a tax deduction. So that might be a
funding source that if you had the proper documentation
as the umbrella of the organization
could give benefits to the members. And if
Anthropic ever goes back to its old billing
rules that people who are members might be able
to get to the discount that was discussed
about a month ago when the billing rates were
much higher and those kinds of things, because
it might be useful to start looking at
those sorts of things to get more advantages
for the organization. I've got some legal
skills that are pretty rusty, and I'm not
allowed to practice law, but I don't have to do
that just to look over documents as a member
of an organization. I love it, John.
yep we'll reach out certainly uh we've done
um the registration because we are a
not-for-profit we've done registration with
technical organizations that give discounts
to software um and we have been rolling
that out but you're right there are
some constitutional things that i think
would benefit from um your professional
experience um so we're we so just as an
fyi We're currently incorporated as a
Canadian not-for-profit. As we grow, we'll
likely have to explore what that means in
other jurisdictions that we need to operate
within. The most likely being our
friends to the south. We did Canada because
the core crew of us are basically Canadian
and it was easy. um but we as we sort of get
more organized we're probably going to have
to figure out how we can collaborate with the
larger tech companies and that likely means
a not-for-profit in the u.s and a separate
charter foundation something that addresses
the irs requirements we haven't figured
that out yet yeah we're we're we're very organic
all the time yeah We're just a group
of folks that are volunteering our time.
You know, we have no, there's no financial
incentives here other than we have a shared
passion for this tech. Amazing. All right. Is that it?
Anybody else, anything else wants to bring
up? I know I see Chris Royce, our favorite
neighborhood viber. Hey, buddy. Yeah, what are
you even building? um well i've been i've
been trying to optimize fair of mine but
essentially what it is is i took spark right
and then i was seeing you with spark doing
amazing things right so i was like okay so
rUv is orchestrating or managing all these
workers so you know and he's and he's walking
it through the spark process so i was like
okay so fair of mine essentially let me
replace rUv with like 10 orchestrators right
and i'm like okay now i got these orchestrators
they orchestrate out the whole spark
process like or the development process like
end to end it's like that's cool what do i
need now to make this better i need to put
rUv back in the loop right but instead of
having to say rUv as say the manager of the
workers i now have him as the ceo the manager
of the managers right and so that's essentially
what i've been messing with lately is
figuring out how to best input put the human
back in the loop to make the system align best
with user intent and that's been a lot of
fun but it's the same problem I was addressing
earlier when I said that when I do a 50
agent swarm I sometimes lose the ability to
understand what each of the agents are actually
doing during that process so you're trying
to add the kind of introspection as part
of that yeah with like goal clarification steps
mutual understanding documents and then
like anytime that you tell the ai something
it has like a separate database that stores
all your ideas so that's more aligned with your
focus so it doesn't ever go back and do
stuff you told it not to do before again type
of things like that that's really interesting
because you think about big organizations
and how they do that right now you know
they're typically in one of these enormous
collaboration suites right so that is actually
where they would expect to see those sorts
of conversations and and that's actually
where the existing humans whether it be senior
manager or CEOs and what have you would expect
to collaborate with a mixed team of system
actors and human actors working together
and indeed where the interface points
currently already are like people would you know
whether it's Microsoft the Microsoft Azure
platform or obviously Atlassian or an IBM thing,
they would expect to see them in Laskow's
collaboration suites. So maybe we can
service some of your what I imagine are
inside data structures and MD files into one
of those enterprise systems. That would
get attention. All right. Well, I
think that's it. I think we've got to jump.
anyone that's in Toronto next week and that
wants to go to the event there's a massive wait
list but obviously you know us so if you
want in, just ping one of us show up early
if you're going to go to that event and
good luck Vincent and crew in Paris next week
if you need any help promoting that let me
know, I've posted it at a few places you
might want to post it on the AI Prompt
Programming subreddit the thing does pretty crazy
I'm almost at 90,000 subs and uh millions
of views anyway so that if you want the
you know if you want the reddit crew you'll
you'll get them on there and i'm the obviously
creator so i can make sure it gets seen
thank you all right thanks everyone
appreciate it um till next time and again thursdays
we also do live coding creating crazy things
i'm not even sure what i'll create next
week but i'm sure it'll be nuts and uh and
oh we've also put together a production
team for this so we're gonna we're trying to
get a little less wayne's world and a little
more organized as we go forward so we're
going to be putting together a much more
polished version of this with rob and kelsey
and nick and and the rest of the crew
helping sort of put this together so um that'll
probably a few weeks off but if anyone again
this is a volunteer org so if there's
something you're interested in helping with
whether it's legal or producing podcasts or
whatever reach out i'm sure there's a spot for
you where we're free uh video intro submissions
right roof yeah exactly let's see yeah
let's let's see you crazy cool or maybe
we'll get ****** and crew to create the
musical interlude um song or something that
sounds like intel chimes or something all
right thanks everyone thanks good weekend
thanks bye bye take care Thank you.
