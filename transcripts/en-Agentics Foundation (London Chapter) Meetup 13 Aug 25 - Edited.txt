I'm sorry, I have to set up the live stream. Just a minute. Yeah, that's
okay. How are you? Yeah, I can see
it's working. So this is
recording to Zoom. Just give me a
Zoom. Okay. Yeah, Zoom, and I share
the Zoom screen. Nothing else. Lovely. I can't see you,
though. I can only see myself.
I don't know why. Yeah, I'm going to. No worries. Just a minute. I have also created
a PRD. so we'll see what fun we have
today trying to translate that interaction
yeah let me i have to search for the
the zoom window on on my yeah on
lbs and i can't find it oh yeah i can see nice and now i start the streaming okay linkedin because they
don't give you the key you know
the stream key just 10 minutes
before the event and another one
for YouTube let me go to the studio need to switch the
accounts first the UK chapter
account because I set it up yesterday with my channels live coming so this goes to
linked linkedin as well is that right
yeah nice one it's connected
to the agentics foundation linkedin
or your your linkedin on the agent examination
very nice okay okay stream url and the stream key is
oh okay copy what what can i do with the
stream key i can just put it on my oh it's
uh oh you are you are streaming okay lovely
actually yeah and the OBS okay we have had
50 uh confirmation people have confirmed
right so hopefully we should have some a
reasonable audience starting in so we'll see
well I will just message on the group as well
that we are on it. Hi. Oh, not sure. I can only see Benz and I on
the Zoom call. Let me cross-check. Well, Dennis is
saying he's on a wrong place, so I will
copy-paste the link from here and then
paste it onto the main chat right uh did
you set up a teams call by any chance
this is where we are so i uh so denis
uh oh did was there a teams invite in
the invite in this setup let us let
Let me cross check. Zoom. Let us cross.
So, everybody is seeing you now. You are live. Am I? Hello. Yeah. No, I'm basically
referring to Denis. He's put on the chat that he got given
a Teams call. So I have pasted the
Zoom call on the chat. I gave him the Zoom call. All right. Lovely. Let me go back
to LinkedIn. I think the LinkedIn, yeah, okay, you're doing that. LinkedIn is starting now. Lovely. I don't think
anyone should get confused with the
Teams because there's nothing about Teams
on the invite. On the main Luma
page, there's nothing about
Teams. There's Zoom there.
It's very clear. And the link for Zoom
is not mentioned in the Luma link. I'm just
wondering if that may be confusing, but you
have sent it via email to all the attendees,
I'm presuming. Yeah, as a blast, it's in
the invite and also the Google invite has been
sent. But now I don't know how many people
can hear us because I don't know how to.
It's totally forgotten. Okay, currently on
Zoom. So shall we just make a start?
Because I don't think anyone is, it's you
and I on the Zoom call. I need to admit
people because I made it very
secure, I guess. Okay. Let's see. I can't see. Uh-huh. Eight people. Admit. Yeah, we see our members
joining in. Hello. Hi, Chris. Hi, James. Yeah. Yeah. we were just getting
our logistics organized as you would
expect on the first event so um we should
get hi hey ravi great to see you it's
about 4 a.m for you 5 30 now 5 30 for you
in the morning yeah eastern oh you raised
the stakes for the event now dialing
in from new zealand lovely great to see
you hi denis hello all right 6 30 here so
it's pretty civilized. Where are you, Chris? I missed that.
Hello. Sorry. I'm good. Busy, which is why
you've hardly seen me. Right. Given that this is
our first session, so thank you all for
making the time today. I think we are being
streamed on LinkedIn and YouTube. I
think Ben has kindly set that up, but
just for information. And the intent here
is for us to get to know each other
better, I guess, at this level, at
the London level. And because I'm not
sure, I can see, I mean, almost all
of you probably, I saw Armand and
Connor and Jim, Marcus, Max, Peter, So we may have
met, so apologies if I am unable
to, because I'm not able to
see everyone. So there is, I just
thought that we'll start with kind of a
series of questions to say, like, what
is the maturity level of what do we want
out of this goal? And then effectively
get some feedback loop at the end
of the hour or 56 minutes now to say
what value we have gone from this session
and in the future. So I'm going to just
walk the talk very quickly. I just want
to see how many of us do not know about
AgentX Foundation or Claude-flow? Is
there anyone here who does not know? Is
this their first call? Hi, Max. Right, you are on
mute. But to be honest with you, I
will just take two minutes just to
lay the, I guess, kind of cover the
overall ground. And then we've got an agenda
that I will pass over to bens to kind of
socialize but uh i can't share so bens i have
to request you i think to share my screen
so i have sent you a request yes now i
can share so i am going to share my screen
so it is a build session so we're going
to build right but before we go into that
uh if i could kindly request you to please
um answer the first three questions on the
mentee uh meter thing and And meanwhile,
I will just try to spend a minute talking
about Agentix Foundation for those of us who
may not know much about this. So we are
the London chapter of a nonprofit organization
called Agentix Foundation. That's
the website. The whole intent here is that
we want to break down barriers to understanding
and adopting AI. Our mission remains
education first. We want to foster innovation
and basically want to build a community
with yourselves, which will help drive social
impact. but more importantly probably
hopefully every member will be able to know at
least 10 other members well and will form a
network and as members we'll be able to drive
change and also monetize it in suitable measure
so the intent is to enable that right
as a democratic organization it's a
meritocracy so anyone has great ideas please kind of
just mention and you can jump on the
bandwagon we got a lot of materials things like
video.agentix.org i would totally recommend
if anyone has not seen it ask any questions
from the last two years of video you could
learn a lot about agentics from this
particular application itself so video.agentics.org
then we have forming a community which is
community.agentics.org we are trying to
do lots of training accreditation here it's
a work in progress but again feel free to
register have a look if you want to contribute
please contribute and last but not least this
is the london chapter membership form which
i need to find a way of putting on the chat
which I seem to be struggling at the moment
so I'll do it later on and we are just
trying to get to know the members better at
an individual level our intent is that we
should know at least 10 other members pretty
well at a personal level so we can form a community
which is credible so please fill up
and if you would like to be featured in our
member space so we have recently launched
our London chapter page some of the members
wanted to be featured. So they are featured
here. So if you'd like to be featured, you
are please welcome to fill up the form and
indicate your consent. On that note, I will
pause and hand over to Ben. Basically,
Ben, probably you want to talk about the agenda
for today, and then we can get started
with more fun stuff. All right. Thanks,
Mondri. The problem is that the voice
on the live stream is not going out
maybe it's just mine can be heard but um
yeah this is why it is you know we are
doing the first time okay okay yeah so the
zoom is a problem over to you yeah so um the
agenda uh let's see um so we have already
the uh over the first point the introduction
and we're gonna build something with um
ruben's uh close flow um library so it will be
i can hear my my voice sorry through youtube
and i can't mute it anyway um i'm trying
to to you know speak clearly that um we're
gonna start some agentic um app builds uh and
while we are presenting um we we got you know
the swarm will build uh these these applications
in the background and then the end up
to 60 or 50 minutes we go back and we're
gonna uh check what the swarms did for us
completely automatic so feel free to um give
us a nudge how what do you want to build
we have ideas uh what to build actually
so we are prepared because if somebody has
an idea what kind of application to build
uh please reach out i mean on a chat or voice
please tell us some ideas and And then
we've got two guests. Dinis will present
a fantastic system. And maybe Rocky
will be presenting his pretty
innovative idea, a five-year business
plan, completely built by CloudCode,
which usually costs about 10,
20, 20,000 pounds. CloudCode built
it for free, and it's much better
quality than an average consultancy which
have done it. And in the end, as I
said, we can have some really free conversations
and questions. So it will be a
little bit complicated at some point, but always interrupt us on
the chat window if you don't understand
the processes. And we're going to have
a look at getting rid of a little bit of
cloud code anthropic models and but we stay
inside anthropic and um we're gonna use gbt5
we're gonna we can use um open source models
anything which open router and requests the
offers so it's pretty exciting on that note
uh i will go headlong into it but i just
wanted to um just again briefly share my screen
and say that it seems like most of us have
experienced i think you can still you can see
my screen now probably again so looks like
almost everyone probably have a level of
understanding of agentics ai and world flow which
is great so it has it will be exciting
and interactive if you could also please kind
of fill up the other two is that what do you
want to achieve at the end of the remaining
50 or 49 minutes and also effectively any
ideas anyone has what do you want to build we
have got ideas we're going to kick off but
if you have some ideas we will help you get
started as well if you have not done that before
so please fill this up at the moment he
says please wait for the presenter to change
slides so i don't see i only i only saw that
first question on the mentee on the mentee
on the mentee stuff yeah yeah so what about
now do you see it now i have gone to the
second slide now uh i'm learning yeah i'm learning
as well so apologies um if it doesn't work
we're not gonna waste time here i think
whilst we wait for your responses feel free to
put it on the uh zoom chat as well like what
you want to achieve by the end of today's
session and also if you have any ideas to build
today put it on the chat if mentee is not
working but at this note maybe once we hand
over to denis for the first member spotlight
denis probably would five ten minutes be
okay with you yeah yeah as long as you can
give me um all right so um yeah let me just
quickly put it my slides right and um and and
basically uh what i kind of want to just
quickly talk about right is i did this presentation
recently there's the videos online for
a bit longer um and uh and basically is you
know again like you know like i i'm actually
i call it like i want to talk about mcp
security right because i think you know it's an
important topic right although you know i i
am full on here right i'm basically if you
guys can see my slides right you can see the
slides uh yes we can see there's a different
tab which we have to click for those who are
not familiar but yes we can see yeah you
can see the four setups right stuff yes yeah so
basically very quickly i came from a developer
background from the spectrum generation
and amiga i've i've done security i was a cso
up until very recently and i'm i'm full into
gen ai now i'm working on four startups
everything i do is open source i'm building a
bunch of open source projects which i you
know maybe i should cover that next time because
i think they provide a lot of foundations
and uh and this is the stuff i've been
working on cyber boardroom my feeds and two style
startups which i'll cover a bit later on
you know other topics uh what i what i want
to talk quickly about is by the way everything
i i'm going to say here it looks like i i'm
basically maybe putting a bit down on on mcp
but actually i think mcp is pretty cool
very amazing in fact there's a lot of
capabilities and um you know but it's a pretty crazy
thing right and uh and i want to look very
quickly about this mcp is an api you guys
know this right and i i when i was doing this
i kind of come up with this interesting
analysis which is i think mcp is what the swagger
guys these guys here should remember that
and for the old enough remember the wsdl right
yeah uh if they saw this amazing presentation
by brett victor which i highly recommend
and brett victor is amazing right you know
not just inventing on principle this is great
presentation where he talks about api should
negotiate and talk to each other which is
kind of what we want so let's so they basically
ask these questions hey what if the api
was dynamic and fluid what if the clients
were able to dynamically load the apis what if
the server was able to communicate back and
forward what if the api was able to change
definition and this is all great right and
amazing features from a development point of
view but i think on on on the asian world this
can be quite dangerous and i still feel that
there's a there's a space for agents in
the swarm world i think ruben you guys are
doing but more in a real world right at least
some of the practices some of the activities
you want not to say that the swarms are not
real world but in others i actually don't think
we want agents the way you describe it
right now i think we need much more contained
very well mapped agents that actually it'll
perform very specific workflows right especially
because now we're dealing with this kind
of stuff right and then they really didn't
ask what can go wrong with this right so
very quickly mcp allows you to have this client
server host you guys know this stuff the
client asks what you want to do the server can
communicate but also the server can talk
back to the client which i thought the more i
looked at this the more i was going like man
this is so ripe for ***** that's not funny
right um the client literally can ask what
you support which is great which by the way
this is the first blind spot right because you
can do all sorts of injections already here
and then the server tells this what i want
and you talk to each other and then but
there's also this very interesting uh server
to client communications which i think is very
very dangerous right again very powerful
right but you need to be aware of this because
again you want to make sure that your systems
survive the real world and don't get exploited
left right and center right which they're
starting to be by now right so this is one
of the things that is very interesting but
it's also ridiculously dangerous and i actually
think there's a lot of interesting innovation
to be done here which is just even in
the first step of how do you know which
tool to call right and because you know you
cannot give it to all all the tools but that
doesn't really scale so this is the first part
And by the way, there's strings everywhere,
right? And, you know, these days I ban strings
from my code base, right? So you can see
you mix all this stuff. Basically, you got
this, you got that, you got that. And in
a way, the point of an agent is to be able to
do all these things, right? The problem is
that there's prompt injection left, right,
and center here, right? And then there's
resources and prompts. This is
just a way to then go, hey, can you
do a query for me? And then there's these
really powerful but crazy dangerous features,
which is the server can actually talk back
to the client, right? Can you LLM this for
me? can you ask the user this or can you log
this at your end right all of them are you know
dangerous situations right again you need
if you're aware of it then you you can
protect against it right yeah what can go wrong
with this stuff right um but then you know
this is just some workflows you guys on
your talk you know this you know that right what
i think is interesting is this right and what
i was just showing here was that the
idea of a request and sometimes i think we
miss a little bit this on some of the conversations
is that the prompt contains everything
right and sometimes this gets a bit hidden but
your prompt usually when you get sent contains
the first question the second and the
third and the fourth and the fifth although yes
this can be exponential he does so the way
the other lamps does they compress some of
this stuff right so after a while you get
some compression going on but your prompt still
has all the stuff on it or a lot of it and
this is part of the problem when you look
at MCPs because the problem is strings right
and by the way I would I ban strings now for
my code base and i recommend you guys to
kind of do the same thing right because a string
is a freaking gigantic thing right of four
gigabytes or more right of all sorts of
characters right so i use stuff like this in my
python code which is strongly type strings
so a more accurate view is this so everything
right here is potential injection right and
then when you look at mcp world what happens
is the host goes to the servers and going
hey dude what you got we got a list of stuff
right and then they get all these lists of
tools so basically if you look at this loop
this is just the mcp host booting up and
then get a nice list of the tools and then
which is basically they can handle these flows
and then this is what happens right you get
an instruction that basically the host then
goes and figure out what to do this is again is
very dangerous picks the right tool makes
the call and then figure out are we done
yet loops and loops and doves and there's
these things right the problem with this right
is every one of these places a place for prompt
injection and i mean if you have seen
recently people have been putting prompt injections
in all sorts of places google docs dns
records web pages you know responses all sorts
of places right so i think this is really
interesting the problem is that we need really
need to beef up our infrastructure right
in order so that this is not a problem right
because uh yeah there's some exploit parts
here which is i call this can you can you
llm for this so you can uh this is the server
to the client right you can attack uh you can
attack the user directly because you can ask
the user questions again very dangerous
and can you in inject logs into the client
stuff which is again you know another place for
indirect in fact this could even have prompt
injections on the admin interface which
is very powerful right and and this is the
crazy feature right the llms can actually change
the definition on the fly which basically
means that if you don't log everything like i
was mentioned a second you have no idea to
even be able to reverse engineer what the ****
just happened right after after the fact
right so the problem to defend is and this
is what i think there needs be a lot of
innovation and i actually think each of these is
a it could be a separate company or it could
actually be an api workflow and i actually
think that even the swarms you know they
handle some of this but i think we need to way
improve these capabilities which is we need to
log everything post data we really don't
have good identity access management for our
agents we really need better identities we
don't have solution for projection os has massive
gaps most databases don't have integrity
and transaction and that's a show left
front and center and we still don't know how it
works apart from that right it's what can
go wrong right um but that's what i think i
really want you guys to think about and and the
way i handle this is using semantic graphs
and creating state flows and and basically
in a way limit a lot what the lm can do and
in a way what i like about the swarm stuff
is i like this idea of evolving going very
wide and then going very slow right very small
i like this idea that you can start with
very wide LLMs that show you the art of the
possible and then you experiment experiment
and then you start to have smaller models
some of the stuff that again Ruben is doing
with custom models like unique temporary there
are interesting but I like my models to
be all customized and eventually you might
even arrive at code that does that or you
have very limited places where you use the
LLMs so that's kind of my approach right it's
about making stuff deterministic and some
of these things you know you just can't control
at the moment and I still feel that the
way we should really be controlling a lot
of this is through identity access management
so that you almost have real-time identities
real-time privileges so that even when the
stuff goes over the place the actual agents
cannot do this and i think we get this
right and the agents will be a lot more
successful because there's a lot less areas for
damage and that's kind of it right it's all
nice you know let's accelerate thank you
dennis i think great i think i'm basically
um look requesting the members if you have any
questions on what we have heard please feel
free to drop them on the chat i guess what
we'll do is that we'll quickly move on to
the build before we go to the next member
spotlight and then there have been a number
of great ideas on the chat so you could
follow along um in the interest of time what
i'm proposing and am i okay to share my screen
again yeah you are you are showing a screen
now am i showing my screen okay it's a
bit confusing what is happening here are you
okay i can't see your screen you can see my
screen you can see my i can't it's nothing
uh i can london agenda doesn't be there all
right yeah yeah sorry so i was driving my son
to his tuition lessons this morning and i
realized that i went too much in a hurry
and i did not set up my navigation on my tesla
right and then what happened by the time
i set up the direction i realized i was
already on a route that had a lot of traffic so
i waited in the traffic for 20 minutes so i
said and i thought like i was thinking
like what do we build today so i said well
maybe this is a good use case so could we have
an app that i could just specify the
destination as i get ready to leave home and it
goes about and looks at traffic information
from public sources and recommends the route
i should avoid right so i said you can mock
up data maps traffic geolocations just help
me demonstrate this idea in the spirit of
building is the new talking motor which
i'm trying to kind of socialize and that we've
got this session today i want a prd but this
is ravi back to your question how i approach
it that will help me use the ai system
to create a realistic application so i just
use gemini here right so as we say created
a plan and i have a prd here which talks
about interestingly uh it gives the problem
like unpredictability of the familiar journey
uh lots of stuff i will open source this
so you can have a look and interestingly it
also creates a vision i mean which is expected
but it creates some persona which is
interesting i never asked it to create a persona
which is basically alex tech savvy parent
um you know basically chloe the hybrid
professionals lots of frustrations about last
mile problem etc etc and then tuition run it
picked that up so what i've now done and
is just a very quick question i've got two
instances here just to show you how to get set
up i have set up one properly which is um
does anyone not know here how to set up
Claude Flow and Claude, is there anyone here
who doesn't know that? I could see in
the comments that there was a couple
of people who don't know. I think it
would be great to. Okay, we will do
that. We will time box that to three
minutes to show that. So first and
foremost, guys, go to Google and search
for Claude Flow. You will come to
this code base here. I'm presuming
everyone here has used GitHub
or Codespaces, or is there
anyone who hasn't used GitHub
and Codespaces? Assuming, if you
haven't, just reach out to us. We will
show you later on. But assuming you
have, I have created a Codespace here,
which is, this is the proper one. This is
the improper one. I am going to, I'm
on the Codespace here on the
main directory. And so basically it's
a temporary cloud infrastructure. I'm going
to copy this command. What I'm doing is that
I'm asking, cloud code from entropic to be
installed in my code spaces one thing to call
out it is preferable you can use cloud code
on your local laptop but there is something
called cloud flow which especially if
you're using swarms you should not use on your
local laptop it's not recommended you can but
it's not recommended because we as i think
denis was saying we still don't fully understand
how some of this works and they are they
can go against your instructions so it could
damage your laptop so preferable to do it in
a safe location which is a code space which
you can throw away yeah i will remove
preferable from that word now now please don't
be alarmed when i say dangerously
skip permissions it basically i don't want
to keep pressing the yes button all the
time it's okay it's a temporary space
so i'm going to just say Claude. I've
installed Claude code here and I'm going
to invoke Claude now. So it's installed on
my code space here. When I do that, something
will pop up saying, how do you want your
interface to look like? I'm just going
to select default and it says Claude account
with subscription. I do have an account
where you can use your API billing, one of
these two options. I'm just going to go for
that. Now, the thing is that I'm logged in
as my personal email address and my my
account is on my um other gmail account which
is my company account right so there's a
problem when i copy paste it goes to localhost
and it doesn't work which you'll see it
goes it happens i don't know why this happened
so i close the window and i go back to my
uh main one and i copy that again and if
someone can help me why this happens i would
be grateful because i don't understand why
this happens sometimes it doesn't work for
three four times then it starts working
sometimes it works in two times it just worked
you see and i don't understand why this
works so i just copy paste on software
development that these are the mysteries yes and
i press that so i'm logged into my
subscription and i press enter and i said what
can is general warning fine no problem use
recommended settings and i said because
you remember i said dangerously skip
permissions is confirming. I said,
no problem, I'm happy. There it is.
Now I'm going to open another
terminal here and all I'm going to do
is copy-paste. I'm going to
install the latest version of Roof's
Claude-flow. I'm going there and
I'm pasting that and running it. Now
you will see lots of files are going to
get created on the left-hand side. Okay
to proceed? Yes. What this is doing,
what Claude-flow really is, again is it's got
some commands to make lots of agents spawn
and do work in a very coordinated fashion
and you can please feel free i have created a
tutorial on it if anyone is interested it's
work in progress so please provide feedback
and help improve it if you go to my repository
which is github.com mondry spark evolution
just go through the readme file is broadly
up to date So there are some courses I
have tried to create by interrogating the
repository of Claude-flow. So please have a
look, tell me it is good. If you
are better than me, because I'm learning
as well, help me improve it. So
that's the ask. Now you see all these
files have been, I don't need this
one. So this is the proper one that
I had. This is the improper one I said,
but you see all of these new files
got created here. Yeah, this is how
we get started. from here on we can
actually um we'll create something so before i
go to that what i had also done is you know
the deep research we did i converted that
into an md file and that md file is here
and what i'm doing here is i'm saying i want
to build an application live along the lines
of the requirements in that document so use
the at the rate symbol like here if you i
can't go up i can just show you probably very
quickly by going down there again sorry
if i'm repeating i'm just trying to keep it
very basic because some people may not have
seen it so what did i do oh yeah that's fine
so if i remove that you see when i use at
and i say prd it detects that and i say just
press enter we have around 40 minutes to
complete the exercise it is meant to educate
and at the same time build something that
is realistic and can be trialed or assessed
using my laptop here what should i use the
reason i ask that question is for a reason is
that if you go back to the cloud flow there
are two ways we can do things one is called
the swarm mode the other one is the hive
mind command which means you have a queen agent
which coordinates in hive mind for more
complex issues so i'm saying you know what
i'm just going to ask you what i'm lazy and
i'm going to just ask Claude, what should I
do? So you said, you just synthesize test
-driven development approach. So again,
test-driven development approach, I think those
of us who have been developing, I think we
all know developers in the past or currently,
the TDD is recommended. There are two schools,
the London School and Detroit School, as
I learned from Roof. The London School
means you write all test cases
first before you write a single
line of code. Sometimes it doesn't
work here. That needs to be investigated.
Why? But there is a file called cloud.md
here so this cloud.md file you can modify
i'm just using the out of the box file and
this is the basically secret sauce this
tells ai how it should work so the rules are
defined here there is another course
that i had shown you before which actually
explains to you about cloud flow so you
can go through this course and kind of get
and give feedback now all i'm going to do is
press the enter button now saying i would also
want you to document yeah I also said you
should synthesize etc etc I would also
want you to document how the different agents
work together to build the product that is
necessary so the audience can look at the file
and understand the process better later
on right so if I press enter here and I agree
up here we will wait let's see what it is
this combobulating I don't know what that
means and we'll give five minutes and then
we will switch across to the next member
spotlight it'll build on its own but i want to
get the process started with yourself it says
i will use a swarm approach as it is more
suitable for rapid coordinated development
with clear agent roles so now it is going to
create a comprehensive development plan using
multiple specialized agents working in
parallel so we'll give it another few minutes
so that's the to-do list that's the plan you
see that's it'll create a topology whether is
hierarchical or star or circular is a
ring i think that is called it will determine
so it's going to initialize a swarm with
specialized agents and set up the project
structure so it's doing the work and the reason
this is happening on its own is i said
dangerously skip permissions otherwise i would
have to keep pressing the yes button every
time i'm not doing that one of the things i
think is important to to clarify here right
is that and this is where i use the worldly
maps reference right of explorers villages
and town planners what i think is super
amazing on this approach is that this is about
exploring the art of the possible right this
is not about creating a production ready
material this is not what town planners does
right this is in the early days of genesis
and custom build what we can now do is use
this experiment let these swarms go out
experiment do all sorts of stuff so in the end
you get a really good solid solution and
i think that's when you then once you have
that solution that's when you should you
need to hand over to another workflow where
then is about locking down that functionality
so in a weird way here is where we can afford
to be highly insecure highly experimental
failure here is is a feature of this
solution right and the swarms just allow that
to occur in a much more interesting and
effective and iterative way that's excellent
i think that's a great product idea actually
that you just said denis is this is like
proper adoption of this into into an enterprise
system right so like my ideation to yeah
and if you guys read about the worldly maps
what's interesting about and simon worldly
is amazing guy but he he does definitely
have these interesting concepts of you do need
to hand over because they are different
focus right and i think one of the problems
we're having at the moment with a lot of
these conversations is is both ends are good
but they're looking at the formula wrong side
the this allows us to create very effective
solutions but this is not the production
stuff on the other hand the production stuff
right you know we'll look at this and going
that's not how you create things you go
no but this is how you then hand over right
to the next generation right not generation
next sort of individual or group who will then
really lock this down and make into a product
and eventually make into a commodity right
excellent so what we're going to do is
that it is going to work so instead of looking
at the screen i guess again i guess if
bence you can stop my screen share maybe we
move to yourself for the next spotlight is rocky
here just checking rocky are you here uh
i will message yeah yeah i'm here yeah i'm
here oh rocky uh do you want to go for
between you and bands whoever wants to go
first i guess um i don't mind really i don't
think i'll take that long i've got a problem
with this live stream it's it's frozen uh so
the the obs software what we are looking
at now for the first time is not working
at all it's okay we are recording this
anyways right this is recorded isn't it so
we will do something about it let's not
bother with that i think the people who
are here that's great so rocky over to you
okay one second uh let me just give a 30
second introduction about what you are so
dinner sorry we didn't ask you could you
give a 15 second introduction of you know
i think you did right at the beginning you
did yeah yeah yeah i've been around
doing a bunch of gen i startups and everything
i do is open source so happy to help
and contribute okay yeah well what are
you rocky yeah so hi guys so quick one you
show this recording it doesn't zoom doesn't
say it's recording no it i said on
my side it says it says recording all
right yeah it says yeah i hope so all right
cool all right good shall i get going
yes please rocky right okay hi i'm
joining you from the beach right now oh
no this is like a zoom sort of uh i
don't know how to turn it off i don't
usually use zoom um i'm actually in
the car right now so it's better than
that view i suppose so yeah i introduced
myself i've i'm ceo of a company called kaipe
ability i just started this company last year
and i'm sort of into advanced manufacturing
and for people who don't really know around
advanced manufacturing is cyber physical
systems in manufacturing is how i kind of
describe it so when you see things like 3d printing
multi-axis machining 3d inspection inspection
metrology digital twins robotics ai and
shop floor you name it it's about the
synthesis of all this technology together in
order to create to create value human value right
and symbolic value but I started my own
company last year to sort of to focus on the
trend of reshoring the fact that we struggle
as human societies to really translate
technology from R&D into commercial viability
and scale up right what people call it different
sort of industries use different terminology
I call it the valley of depth and yeah and
then I got involved with the agentics
foundation through roof and that was in january
i think i don't know how i managed to get
involved i used to do some beta testing for
open ai i was asked to be a business fellow
for perplexity last year so maybe just through
some linkedin chat i saw him followed him
joined the brigade in january february time
so that's sort of my involvement with the
sort of program i suppose is that good enough
for you mandeep for an intro perfect perfect
rocky you've got to keep me in check you
know i'm going to then put my timer on you have
got well we'll got 10 minutes i mean i hope
you i think we'll go over a little bit if
uh if you know feel free to drop off but
i'll stay back but we'll not rush it right we
have first time so over to you rocky yeah well
i'll just share what i've been working
on i didn't i don't really share much i'm
not a sharer um on social media i'm old school
i suppose sharing is caring rocky well a lot
of my sharing is face to face through you
know phone calls word of mouth sort of thing
um i'm not really on facebook instagram
twitter or anything like that x so i tend not
to sort of do that sort of stuff but i am
getting more into the ai agentics through roof
as well um sorry i'm on my perplexity one
sec and i am interested in it because the main
issues we're seeing around ai everyone has
a view on ai my view is it's absolutely a
game changer and it's not going away just to
ask can everyone see rocky screen yeah the
github one um yeah all right lovely yeah
so i just started this last uh in january
something my own github i'm not a coder as
such i do basic sort of macro in excel i've
never done python or anything i tried i tried
to do python coding for my energy usage
and that's about as far as i got so something
like Claude code coming up upon us you know
and manas has really been a game changer
for me to sort of take from what's in my ideas
and create prototypes but the Claude Flow
idea it's really sort of sparked a lot of
interest for me in that you know the ability to
have different personas working together and
checking each other's work is a really powerful
tool I see absolutely the future being
having a team if not individual AI agents
within each team who either represent that
team or you know interface with the wider
organization so I think this is going to be a
huge stepping stone in terms of that but but
being a solopreneur you know I've gone from a
corporate environment where you have a lot
of feedback a lot of people in a lot of
departments to engage with just to yourself so
how do you sort of do this in the startup
sort of sense and organization where you
can't afford to hire a board of directors and you
can't afford to have teams working on you
and that's why I think agentics and AI with
agents really is going to be a huge sort of
a game changer for us. So the demo I just
basically wanted to show you is like I said
that the big issue is how do you take my idea
and put it in front of a VC, put it in
front of an investor, a bank you know a research
organization and what it what they always
ask for is a business plan right but with
ai you get you get ideas every single
day right in terms of business plans so to
sort of curate and use a magentic swarm which
can then act as your board and support you
with a business case and a business proposal
is actually quite a powerful tool i feel
right and that's what i've kind of applied
um the agentics form towards do you want me
to go through sort of how or maybe at a
very high level maybe rocky just to show
like because what your linkedin post yesterday
was really amazing so i think it'll be great
to socialize that uh i mean maybe time
limited to five minutes but give us a broad
brush overview so my approach to the ai now
is use every single tool that comes out the box
and use it straight away and that's how
i'm kind of learning so if you come on my
pc i've got perplexity open i've got Claude
open i've got chat gpt still running you know
i've got google i've got like open router
i literally have everything going on at
the same time so whilst comet is filling in
a form or doing some research for me on
something i've got Claude running code i've got
chat gpt working on something else or i'm
typing questions to it and i've got perplexity
doing lab reports for me so it's just like
that's my team right now right and it's saving
me full-time engineers so the way i kind of
focused it for for this project was i saw
a comment from Reuven it's always Reuven
that triggers the ideas saying just ask ai um
you know where do you see yourself in five
years time right and and i say ai chat gpt
and chat gpt has got an edge on other ais
until just actually recently with claude and
that seems to know you very very well through
the fact that it kind of reads the entire
history continuously and uses that as context
so i typed that into chat gpt it says this
is where i see your company going in five
years time and it was just really sort of
brilliant right in terms of how it kind of
forecasts a journey for your own company so
then I said okay let's work on this and create
you know a multi-year plan we did that and
then I said okay now I'm working with Claude
Flow let's create a board pack using a swarm
of agents to do that right for me in order
to create that board pack so i got actually
chat gpt where am i here we go to create
basically my claude md file not necessarily
roofs yet because i haven't got that far
yet to use claude roofs claude flow and it took
out everything that it knew about me and
my company based on previous previous chats
and transcripts and it basically created
firstly what my mission statement my mission
was for the Claude MD it created a board for
me based on my chat history it took out it
created files based on the source data of
what it knew about my company doing its own
due due diligence and I was very explicit
saying there may be information that you don't
actually have and this is where you have to
now use rag and you have to go and use and
find out the information using the swarm where
there's gaps in the information and then
it built my if you can read then it built my
agentic swarm right which which were these
personas so planner orchestrator financial
monitor gtm enterprise architect strategist
etc etc right so you copy you copy all that
put it into your claude md file also put in
your source data in terms of what my financials
are of the company where i am as an
individual where i think my business case is
going what i'm trying to do you know etc etc
which already chat gpt knew about me and then
it overall created my business case
for me and business proposal do you
want to see a bit of that i mean
yes yes please so i made it private
because there's a lot of private
information in you but it but what i've
noticed about it is that i i was expecting
it to fall over right and just have
so much spurious data so much stuff that's
just not relevant missing gaps in
information i know rufe did a demo about some
trading agents and then he was doing the
demo and he was like opening folders and
the folders were empty but i think because
chat gpt supported me in terms of the md file
and also the specific prompt to put into
clode there was literally no folder and
no part of the business case that was left
untouched and checked over right and also
it was ragged and you can see next time
i'm going to ask for some extra traceability
but it basically created an entire
business case end-to-end for me right so
executive summary market problem
what's the solution what's my funding
strategy what do i need to do based
on where i am today what are the
actual financial models you know so
if i just open that you'd expect it
to be empty but it's not it's all
full it's full of actual relevant
information realistic numbers you
know it goes on and on and on right so you
think okay well maybe there's something that's
missing out what about an implementation
roadmap and it's all there yeah what how do
i go from 48k revenue which is where i am
today on a single client to a growth path and
step by step how to do that right and that's
really massively powerful for someone like me
right now let's make a small comment the
thing that's ridiculously powerful about this is
that when you create this you still review
everything right you still read everything
the difference the difference so in a way
this is still your work this is still your
words what you've done was you steer the ellen
lambs to say here is the path you know there's
50 different paths you can go that's the
one i want to go and it just makes you
ridiculously more effective right and also it has
the advantage that now as you progress on
your path you can just go to the LM and say
hey can you just update this based on the
latest stuff so the overhead of creating
this is now ridiculously short yeah right and
that's the key and also what i found is like
you also have like no psychological dependency
on the pain to create this which basically
means that if somebody says hey can you do it
like this and can you change it like this
absolutely yeah you know like dude i just
spent freaking a week right months and yeah
put so much effort into it exactly right yeah
that's the key i think that some people miss
is the fact that you've decoupled almost like
your ownership of this this is just a
physical almost like one representation of your
ideas that you will change and modify and
slice without any emotional attachment to it
absolutely really can i ask you question rocky
there um what what what's interesting i
want to think of where you started from where
you said uh i believe you said that people
can you don't you're an individual sitting in
your car right now but you know you came
from a corporation and and now you you can as
an individual you know have much more leverage
because you have ai essentially just to
park absolutely so the thing i always used to
say when i started the company and i seek
them out through just people mentoring me is
you'd lose that you do lose that kind of
independent mentorship in the board right and
you miss that you know that motivation of a
board motivation of your peers to kind of say
you need to deliver not just for yourself
for the company right it's one thing to have
your wife and kids saying when you're going to
pay the mortgage but it doesn't really frame
your business very well it just panics
your business so to have sort of a board which
is your own chosen board at the point actually
of starting a company not waiting for 10
years down the road where you can afford one
is it's just massively powerful and do you
think so looking at this at the screen right
now i'm seeing hiring um i'm seeing a lot
of things that to me actually are are anti um
so so there's not anti but um anti-ai because
it seems like have created you more of
an old world business plan um do you think
that's the case i'm only just reading the screen
so i'm not yeah i think that i think
organizations are going to exist they might just
not be as big as they used to be because you
just don't need that many no the size grows
inefficiency so i don't think that i'm never
you know i can't run look at i'm saying
i'm running comet i'm running perplexity i'm
running five different ais in one go that
should be five people i can't you can't humanly
do that unless you're an octopus right so i
can't see myself not having specific roles
and people running departments in the future
yeah those departments just may be smaller i
completely agree right i think what we'll see
first of all i think we're need more
developers not less right and also think that
we will see a lot more smaller teams and and
teams that have basically almost as an ability
to operate at a level that today will be
impossible right in the past speed yeah dude
if you went to a team and you said like am
i cyber teams right if i went to them and says
hey guys before you do anything i want a
risk assessment i want a pnl i want a project
management i want structure i want
documentation i want this this this this this they'll
go f you right because they wouldn't do it
right and they couldn't do it because they
didn't have time now we can so i think our
ability to create multidisciplinary teams
and i completely relate to that that ability to
bounce off ideas to multiple personas is
absolutely amazing yeah i mean the thing i
suppose just to bounce off that a bit is that my
first involvement with generative ai was
before chatbots and llm ai because i did we
did a lot of generative design in ai for actually
manufacturing and what happened was the
opposite effect you think you're using an
efficiency tool so you say hey all i need to
do is give my software my requirements and
it's going to generate the geometry for the
product for me i mean how brilliant is that
yeah so if i want to design a screwdriver you
just give this functional requirements to the
software it does all the fea it does all
the material selection it does all the
manufacturing method and it gives you a design but
it doesn't give you one design right it gives
you 30 to 50 designs yeah so now your problem
has actually gone your bottlenecks has
moved right to the human which says now i've got
50 designs different manufacturing methods
different cost models different materials
different geometries now instead of validating
and pushing one through my whole new
product introduction process i could have
30 products i need to validate in one go yeah
but now we can experiment and i think that's
the power the power is that what you can now
do yeah is you can experiment those 30
very fast with a low low cost and then find
the one that actually takes to the next phase
and then you could also experiment on that
it's a change of it's a total change the
game but the labor the labor goes up it just
moves it moves the labor yeah but by the way
the way i've done this which is so so you've
done almost always like go and do me
everything the way i've done this same business
plan which I put on the links is I created
voice memos of every area of the business
plan and then I give it to ChatGPT and Claude
and I created almost every document of the
investor pack and only when I have every
single document multiple iterations is I created
the business plan so I found that by the
time I got to make the business plan it was
actually using my own ideas my own references
on the marketing strategy the technology
strategy the hiring the people etc the
financials blah blah blah blah right and i found
that quite an interesting way it's almost
like you do a brain dump but on the end of
every brain dump you have these ridiculous
well-written documents really just it's just
you know the world's your oyster so that's
it i'm wondering thank you i think uh i
i learned i think i'm gonna probably try
trial this actually this is well if you want
to go let me i'll help you out don't worry
about it i'll show you how to do it because
it's just relevant to me and and i'll
show you how to set it up one thing i did
notice actually which just sort of to allude
to is i was actually at google with um tier
bolt from voice ai and i think that's
the next thing coming believe it or not so he
they were demoing voice agents but having
basically five or six in a room right and having
conversation with multiple ais in
parallel seamlessly yeah imagine that so like now
now instead of uh the next phase will be i
should be able to plug this straight into the
voice ai agents and they will grill me and
ask me questions yeah saying here's your
checklist what where are you yeah where are
you on your milestones what's happening what's
your excuses for not doing stuff um and i
think that's really coming very quickly you
know by the way that's one of the problems
i'm trying to solve the cyber boardroom which
is talking to multiple personas but also to
communicate upward sideways and downwards
in you know with multiple personas and the
persona is not just a person is the person
the culture their role their task what they
want to do right and i found some very powerful
cases like you talk about where having a
persona you want to present something and
then seeing what would this persona react to
my information yeah and suddenly you start to
realize that if you want to communicate
for example with board members or executives
or your peers etc you need almost to have
highly personalized focus message to each one
and again now we scale that where in the past
we didn't yeah and actually personas like
that voice ai demos actually suit this sort
of view because board in boards people don't
say very much right so you do the talking
first and then that's where it suits whereas
i don't think you can get this cacophony
of voices at the same time but then use semantic
knowledge graphs to capture that yeah
and that's how i get deterministic improvidence
yeah yeah i think that's going to be the
future yeah so hopefully that's enough for
you yes thank you um again everyone please
leave your questions comments on the chat uh
we will act after the meeting uh let's let
her look at what we are doing what's happening
with our swarm so i am sharing my screen
but it's not showing up here can others see
my screen we're not sharing i think we're
still seeing the previous screen you can switch
the tab on zoom on oh they've introduced
this new feature there is a there are tabs
on the top of the zoom and rockies and yours
you're right there you go yeah that's why i
got confused and by the way benz i think in
linkedin i saw it all people sees my top half
of my face so maybe we are sharing the
wrong pinning the wrong screen on the on the
share i was aware i was aware of that this
is a obs limitation i adjusted now so it's
not cropped anymore okay but there was a lot of
technical problem okay so okay no problem
you have got so a lot of work still ongoing
by the way it's not completed um so i will
let it continue it's still working it's
consumed 1.6k tokens at the moment um and what has
it done uh last time looked there were a
bit more information so obviously lots of
files and testing just has been configured so
the tdd has been applied i saw that before
but it's disappeared now from the view so
it's still working so we will let it work now
over to you benz um um arno i noticed you
haven't used code spaces before so towards the
end of the call if we have time we'll quickly
show you how to set up a code space so i
made a note of that so then over to you
yeah i've got a question how do you make these
files off local again when you finish
with code spaces because this is
being deleted after a while,
after a week or two. Which files? That swan click. So
this is what I will do. Because I initiated
it from within GitHub, the code
space was started from within GitHub,
I'm already connected to Git. So what
I'm going to do, I've got a Git
ignore file already. So I'm presuming it
is, I'm just going to upload at the
moment. It's nothing confidential. but
obviously people have to check i'm
going to add to git uh basically git
commit uh checkpoint commit uh spelling
wrong checkpoint commit um sorry git minus
m right yep so i forgot about that yeah
so basically the answer is you you push it
to github right yeah and then get push so
it is going over to git push here
compressing done so here if we go into my git
up there was nothing here before there
should be something here now there we go
right so now you can download actually so i'm
going to stop sharing benz over to you
all right thanks uh so i'm going to give a
little bit of context uh if i find the
share button now uh here that's yeah here
we go and i'm gonna only share my terminal
window so just we are very focused on
that uh can you guys see it yes okay so love
the old school green on black yeah I love
that matrix kind of thing so I'm going to
create a new directory sorry and if you've tried
out cloud code it's working with anthropic
models I show you now the list of
models very important so I gave access to
the to the folder so you type model slash
model and you see that we've got opus which
is a very expensive model so you have one
or two hours a day and then it goes to
sonnet but you can stick with sonnet if you
want to save or if you want to consistency
but what happens if you know entropic has
a problem they've got a lot of problems
and you know quality degradation in the last
few weeks but you you might say that okay i
want to try out some different models i
want to see how gpt5 is doing how the
chinese models and so on and that's that's where
when you need to use start using some
routers and routers are supported by by this
system so entropic allows you to get rid
of the factory models and and try something
new so you say exit and you need to
install we're going to share the link later
and send to everybody all the participants
and you it's an npm instruction so it's
very easy to install one line and then
you have a kind of a running, is it called
library? I don't even know what the
was the ACLI was the official term, but you
can start this with CCR. This is called
Claude code router. That's why CCR start. And it starts
as a server. So at this point,
when it's running, you need to open a new
terminal window i hope it's still you can still
see it um and you say no i think we're seeing the previous
previous okay let me share the the new one and you say sorry i need to
cheat a little bit ccr start
sorry no claude code actually it
has been recently changed from claude
there was another instruction how
to launch but now you can see that
this is a different now so we are
using the router the steps are the same
so it welcomes us that cloud code uh it's
running already but if you look at the model
list the exactly the same step what we did
before uh you will see uh different models
uh some at you know i don't know why but it's
it's not loading for me um they i spent like
five hours today to to prepare this but
uh it's not it's not showing up uh i don't
know why but as a fifth or sixth option you
can see the models here but I show you the
method once you manage to set it up
you say model again and you type in
the provider it can be Gemini it can be
DeepSeq and slash the version of the
model so this is the format so I
switch over to GPT-5 Let's see if
I manage this. I think it's
not working now. But the steps are
exactly the same. It changes to GPT-5
and it confirms that the model switch
has been happening. And any time you
can switch back. so let's say
you invest one or two minutes
to set this up you are able to
use open source models, locally
run models you can download the GPT
OSS and run it via LMStudio or OLAMA
and so on if you have a heavy laptop or
advanced machine so you are not tied
to entropic anymore so that's the cloud
code router and you can it's in beta but
requestee supports this as well so you
can choose whether you use open router
or requestee as a vendor as a wholesaler
and then you can follow all the logs
you can follow your consumption, you can
save a lot of money with this and you have
the possibility to use the Chinese models.
Gwen from Alibaba. So Benz, quick
question here. So if we do
have one of the Cloud Code subscriptions, we'll obviously use
a normal way, right? Which is the one I
showed. But obviously you're saying if we
have an issue and we'll use the other models,
so this is the switch. But you use Cloud
Code there as well. I was not sure
I fully... I didn't manage to
start properly this system. I
practiced all day, but this is the typical. But I'll show you
what I mean on... We'll do a follow
-up. We'll do a follow-up, maybe a
quick snippet later on and then share
with the audience. Yeah, so this is what I wanted to just finally show you just
a little bit. Can you see my requestee? Yes. tab so if you
set up this router via requestee
then you see the exact balance you
can see the library so you can choose
from 419 models and of course you
can use the entropic ones but it doesn't
make sense because you have already a
subscription to cloud code but you wouldn't
want to do this, so it's better to
use the most advanced models that are available through Requesti,
the GPT-5, the open source
OSS, and the Chinese ones, which is very
practical, as just the last sentence, that
you can see the logs and what's
happening under the hood. Every input that
you do, it's logged and you can see the
cost of it and you can see the the the
system prompt how the system creates
your um your input so this is something
for the technical thank you bence uh
again questions please put on the chat uh i
know we've gone over the over the our our
slots but let's have a look at what is happening
on our build what i've realized because
I particularly prompted it to use test-driven
development. It is actually doing that,
but it is taking a lot of time because it's
writing all the tests. I'm going to share my screen quickly
to show you. We have lots of
tests written, actually. You need
tests here, as you can see, traffic
-monitoring.js. If I open one of
the sample things, it's written all
of the stuff here and it's working
through. Obviously, it's hit an error
now. It's going to fix the error on its
own and continue so i'm not doing anything
do you want to share the screen
oh i am not sharing for correcting
me what about now yep is it any
better so i'll repeat whatever
i was saying because i particularly
asked it to do tdd and things are moving
very fast so i can't scroll up much it's
creating all the test driven develop test first
and that's what is taking it such a long
time but it's at work and as you can see here
is a random basically test file it's using
jest here it's writing all the tests here so
once it does that i think that's where it
is going to it's still working not working
sequential it's still working there's a
coordinator here working and the spark coder is is
active but it's still working i think on the
ts file here it's a test fine here right
so you see that's a few questions you know
while it's doing its thing I've seen that
you know it compacts the conversation at some
point it does and then and also later on it
can do things like oh this test is not passing
I'll skip this test or I'll change the
test so that you know it's it's not going to
fail things like that what's your experience
because I have seen that happening later
on and what is the consistency from enterprise
scenario what you need is consistency so i have
had mixed experiences to be honest and
i'm still learning right so i think obviously
the experts here who i think many probably
people here actually please feel free to
share your experiences but i have been able
to create really sophisticated apps i'm
still on the journey but with a level of
orchestration i see myself as the orchestrator so i'm
basically monitoring but I would intervene
at some point in time if it is not giving
me a desired view but then it's a it's that
relationship I guess right but it it does
work so today for example I was able to demonstrate
something quite interesting and someone
shared an idea with me yesterday at noon I
had not done anything I kind of all I asked
the person is that just give me a voice
your transcript talk to yourself give me a
transcript that's all I need did the deep
research and we were able to explain something
to an exec pretty you know convincingly so I
think from a prototyping talking a building
is the new talking that aspect it is quite
mature because you can really get your
point across your point about enterprise
consistency what Dennis also highlighted the kind of
that narrowing aspect I think that's
something perhaps as a community we could look
at to make sure how this becomes much more
easy to and and and consistent so I believe
there's some work to do there anyone yeah my
chris what's your views sorry ravi yeah yeah
my feeling is that the lm itself is not
that important it is the the ability to consistently
digest business context is one aspect
and enforcement of like workflow like github
test-driven development all of that
consistently through the process so when it compacts
obviously that with cloud code basic cloud
code it's worse than it is with cloud flow
um because there is a little bit of
enforcement built in there and then you learn
like prompting you know follow this kind of
events has also shared some prompts you know
in the community in general uh so there's
this but i think i'm i'm seeking for for
teaching perspective a consistent set of practices
if you like whether that's prompts or
whatever else yeah we can collaborate on that so
greenwich university We are in touch with
them for a module starting September.
If you are working, I would love to kind of
collaborate. I know Brad is also working
on a few things there. So let's, so yeah,
I'm going off tangent, but
great. But again, members of the
community here, did you have like,
what are your experiences? Like,
please share. I'll maybe just
talk a little bit to what
rUv was asking. It's Peter here. I think I distinguish
between two things. When I see
a lot of the Claude flow elements where
people are prototyping, so I agree that
you get into scenarios where you're
compacting context because you're doing
a lot of things. I compare that to
how we use it in a real code base. So
it's a non-AI code base, and we're
using AI to deliver. I would not expect
to compact context. And the reason is, is
because if I am, that means I'm delivering
two bigger tasks. So if we're doing
features, if we're doing, we're effectively doing
lots of incremental change on an
existing code base within the context of
that existing code base, we want to have the
same design patterns, we want to implement
the same APIs and the like. So I
think there's a very different experience
putting it into an inverted commas real code
base where you're actually trying to
deliver something you'll deliver to production.
versus running swarms where it's very
fluid and you don't really understand what
the end result is. And just on the TDD, that's where we
sometimes get caught. We have to be very
explicit because change the code and
ask it to retest against the TDD or
against the tests. And it will
revert all the code to meet the tests. So you have to be
very explicit to say, I've now changed
my code. I want you to go and update the
tests because the code is correct and
the test is not. So again, you kind
of get these cycles of commits and you
just have to then suddenly be aware
that actually you have to be very
explicit on a commit cycle as to what you
want it to do or else it will try and
revert your code back to the historical
tests, basically. Yep, yep. Okay. I think we should
probably evaluate this a little bit
more separately. So it was it, sorry,
I didn't notice who was speaking.
Who was speaking? Sorry, that was
Peter, yeah. Peter, right? Yeah, I'm
making another. I think Robbie Peter, let's
talk about this. I guess this
is almost, it's progressing. I know it's
back in development, it's ongoing
at the moment. So conscious
of time, but I guess it's open
to the community. There are a few more
questions, I guess, if you could leave on the
comments, like, you know, how useful was
today? like you know you know if you can
say one to less one was it useful to this
session and also probably in future what would
you like to do and also like this is again
democratic meritocracy like anyone like you
know we are community one thing i would
request is a form if you kind of fill it up
just so that we know who the community is
better and also may i request that we each
one of us try to know at least five other
people from the london community right so
let us know each other better than just like
what is your name kind of thing and the idea
is that we are all at different places if
we see opportunities because businesses
need help i think especially the smb
businesses need more help so i guess we are a
community we can pull together to support them
so i know calm you got a hand up so over to
you please oh yeah just a quick one um i'm
helping out with the agentix.org website
creating content and i'm embarking on a series
of fireside chats about just how you
think about Agentex. So, and a lot of that
was brought up today. Dennis was talking
about, you know, about experimentation. This
is a space for creating. It's not just about
rebuilding SaaS. So if you want to
sign up, it's just, if all you need to have
some experience with Agentex, not necessarily
Claude-flow, and would love to start
you in for 30 minutes, it'll be on the agentex
.org website. the content will be there
known by agentics um so if that's okay with
you i can post a link yes please please
please please do okay an open forum now uh
uh please leave your comments whether this
was valuable what more in the future on the
comments and it's an open forum anyone else
any thoughts comments views critique anything
yeah it's interesting conor adams um um kindly
shared offered his office in london so
if we want to build something together it's
very efficient when we physically meet oh
that's great thank you thanks yes please and
also because everyone is everywhere we are
a non-profit all of us are volunteers here
right and i guess we would love to and we
want to help businesses so if any of your
businesses would like to be featured at agentics
foundation we have a sponsorship mechanism
it's there on the website so we welcome
sponsorship from anyone and also any any any
contributions in kind like the office space
to run our events we want to run it every
two weeks initially and i think we got
vincent here i must point out who's trying to
train doing some great work in the france
both uk and france so vincent you might want
to say a couple of words about what you're
trying to do in between France and UK because
I'm in Jersey in the Channel Islands so
I'm a mix between both cultures you're the
bridge yeah that's it I'm the bridge so right now my focus
is on building APIs platform to detect deepfakes audio, video image, text and so on
because it's becoming an issue in this AI world, the
fakeness of things and people get abused
on fake voice calls that try to scam
them and get their bank details and so
on. So I'm building models and I'm
building frameworks to be able to deploy
these models and I use the techniques
that we are talking today, the agentics
techniques we've been discussing so far.
I'm using all of that stuff so yeah,
that's the focus and then maybe next
session I do a demo or show you my my
workflows and so on and and explain
also how i work with low because they
are stuff that make it useful and stuff
that you should be aware of because
they are not quite ready for prime time
so it's important to know what they are
so yeah that's it thank you vincent and
last but not least one of the other
members of our basically co-founding team
by the way anyone others are welcome
to kind of volunteer is chris polter here
who's been doing some amazing work so
chris would you like to briefly introduce
you and what you do yeah for sure for
sure uh so i'm a founder i've been
working on ai stuff about four years now
i guess predominantly for building
stuff and probably like a lot of us
here i'm kind of almost more interested
in the tools and what you're building it's
kind of more fun and interesting and exciting
and constant innovation and and kind of
improvement so i've been on a journey on the
last couple of years trying to optimize uh
kind of ai for coding i guess and yeah the last
six months everything has really exploded
quite a lot i think cursor was the first one
to really make the like a significant difference
to coding if you like beyond the kind of
autocomplete paradigm and then flawed code
really just took it to the next level so a
lot of it is really understanding how you redo
the software development like cycle in the
world of genetic coding right um and yeah
probably at the next call or one of the future
ones i'll be able to show what i'm working
on which is a it's a different type of
orchestration uh tool if you like to to kind of
cord flow uh just from a different philosophical
standpoint if you like um so i believe
essentially in very short iterative loops so
i want to be very controlled about what i
tell the ai to do and i want to validate the
work and then kind of continue from there um
and that's cool when you're working in a
terminal or kind of one but as soon as you want
to build bigger things then actually you know
going through these different tabs trying
to find out where you need to you know approve
stuff or change things and do all that's a
bit of a pain So I'm actually building a kind
of GUI at the moment, which has all the
configuration and orchestration kind of
built in and then basically a task inbox for all of
the agent supervision, if you like. So, yeah,
hopefully I'll be able to give a demo
on that in a couple of weeks time because I
only started working on it 48 hours ago, but
I have most of the interface together already,
which is quite cool. Nice one. and again open to the
floor here anyone wants to share anything
before this is going to continue i'll let it
build and once it is done i may have to
troubleshoot a bit i'll see if i can record it
but then i will share the output with you and
i will also the code base is also public
i'm not sure if i've shared the link so i
will put the link to the code base because
i'm going to periodically check it in on the
chat so you can also look and contribute
and test so there it is on that note then our
first series thank you all for your
participation and we look forward to the next one
in two weeks time if we can do it in person
we'll do it in person and also live cast it
so whatever and please anyone wants to do any
demos member spotlights etc on the database
please drop one of the us here you heard
ben's chris rocky vincent or i right just point
that to us in the group we have a group
at the end of the day so just mention the group
keep the conversation coming thank you all
all right thank you
