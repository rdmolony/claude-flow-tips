right going live hey it's the 24th of
july time flies today i'm i don't have a
huge i don't have a solid plan but i do
have a bit of a plan i'm going to dig around
a little bit in the open code cli maybe
i'll show you guys a little of this web
dashboard that i've been working on for the uh
cloud cloud flow and separate the system
from the use of Claude as much as I can.
But to be honest, I haven't been able to
find any CLIs that really come close to the
ability to sort of run things in a kind of
concurrent fashion. Supposedly, the open
code system does that. So I was going to try
to investigate that a little bit. But in
the little that I've investigated, I've
struggled a little to get uh it looks like
it defaults to like the github use uh
github i don't know what it is basically the
github's llm integration which makes it a
little tricky to use so let me let me
start by showing a little bit what
i'm working on here but and uh well and
welcome everyone and thanks for showing
up to another one of our live vibe coding
sessions all right so for those who are
new that basically all i do is show you
what i'm building and and in real time
so this is this is one of the things i'm
building right now this is a uh something
i it's it's super retro let's just so this
is basically a ui for the front end of claude
uh claude flow and i did it as retro as
i possibly could but basically what what
you're going to see here uh so what i'm building
this is a let's just go back out so
it's a see i don't know what you want to call
it a dashboard i guess so i'm using a
combination of components here i'm using web
sockets to connect to the the back end mcp oops
it looks like a jump it opened that up it's
super retro interface and uh in in this case
we we can see here that i've got a number
of tools here's a web socket i've got
my sync manager i'm looking here's the
information i'm getting so this allows me to sort
of get a feel for how it's going to run how
it's going to operate you'll see that all
the services started that looks good so now
i'm going to go back and we're going to
take a look so there's a few different elements
here you see that there's this sort
of initial dashboard components i don't know
why i've got two scroll bars that's a little
weird i got to fix that but anyway um now
we can go here we can see the swarm i can
uh i can add i can add my various swarm
elements so i can choose and we can spawn a
swarm i can i can choose different options like
an architect or or tester coordinator code
or whatever so then i can spawn it so i'm
going to spawn that we can zoom out i can
add let's see if i can add another one a lot
of researcher spawn that and i can move
those around oh maybe i don't move it around.
I'm not sure. I'm still building it just as
an FYI. I guess my dragging component
doesn't quite work right. I can add tasks,
test, submit that. And that will show up here in the task flow. And we got my various
memory components. This is basically
just showing it how it's storing
the various memories for what's
interacting with it. Lots of information here. This is raw. I
probably got to do a better job of
cleaning it up, but I'll start raw.
The other part I have here is the
MPX integration. So in this case,
I can do different initializations. So
if I want to execute a tool, I go here
and execute that. And we can see the tool
being integrated. You can see all the
various options here. So if I choose like
GitHub integration, we'll see GitHub
components or system and utilities. I
got those as well. This is early. I haven't,
there is a branch that if you guys are
interested in taking a look, uh, that I
had, it's, it's still very, very alpha. I'm
still working, working on it, but, uh, you
get, you'll get the general idea. Basically
I'm creating a UI for all the sort of
system variables and data points. Uh, here's,
this will be memory. So in this case, I'm
going to look at the memory for, you know,
different entries. So this is just, what
I'm trying to do is just give it a better
introspection, just kind of figure out how
it thinks and how it works. So here would
be the high bind components. So this
would give me different options to see the various
components. And then in this case, we've
got a terminal. So the terminal here
allows me to just access the terminal through
a web-based interface. Seems a little
redundant, but why not? So you can see here.
So now I can, let's add a command here. Here,
let's add this one. oh no that's not what
I wanted uh oh you know I need I need
ability to clear this oh I guess I can
select all all right let's choose the right
one uh here's this is a command this is
a useful command by the way for clod code
that allows you to stream the output so
it skips their user interface so in this
case i'm going to say you know test a
con current uh agent swarm so the dash p
prints out the output the output format is
defined as the the json stream and then you need
verbose this is going to be the basis of
how i'm going to add a new feature here in a
moment. So, I'm going to go here and I'm just
going to type that. So, now we can see it giving me the output
each step along the way. So, now
I need to actually render that in a
way that's useful. So, that's the next
feature I think I'm going to try to add
here. I'm going to add a cloud flow
section to the UI and then rather than
invoking the interface using the default
cloud code system which doesn't work
particularly well in in a web browser i'm going
to uh attempt to build an a web-based
interface for it what this is doing
is just showing me the sort of
thinking process this is what happens
essentially under the covers when you're
using cloud code so you can see the
the assistant this is basically you know uh
the request we can scroll to the right here
we'll see more details the id now i could
probably store all that information to a db
as well which i'll do in a later stage roof
yeah did you did you define like in those
logs right there like did you define that
that type assistant or is that actually what
what's being returned from clod and that's
being that's being returned from a clod
you can see the all this there is the assistant
basically okay yeah so this is what you
see if you want to call the system directly
this is how you do it. So lots, lots
of thinking. Claude doesn't
permission to bash. You haven't granted it.
All right. So what I'm noticing is I don't,
I'm not giving it permission. So I'm
going to, I'm going to switch for a moment.
So let me see, I hit control C. Now
what I'm going to do, I'm just going to
go back here for a moment and I'm going
to just test. So what I'm trying to do
figure out exactly how this stuff all works
under the covers. So in this case I'm gonna paste this in again. This one. This time, oh, actually before
I do that I'm going to go and do help
and I'm gonna add the dangerously
skipped permissions. This is way over here. And then I'll put
format, rebose, yeah looks good
actually i'm going to use the
one i just did and i'm going to add
the dangerously skip permissions option
this time what i'm going to do is i'm
going to you know to to do research to
a simple world in, hello. All right, so I'm
just gonna grab that quick so I
have that handy. So once I have that, so this is the
initial output. I know not the most
exciting thing to look at, but this
gives me this direct integration with
their system so I can bypass having to use
the cloud code CLI. All right, and what I'm going to do once
I have that, let's see, is I'm going to
copy and paste this. So this is how it uses
the parent tool use. This last thing,
it basically reverse engineer
their UI. We can see here that it's using my MPX tools. I saw it a
second ago here. Yeah, I was going
to say to Alexander that the minus P
switch basically tells Claude to
reveal everything that it's doing
under the covers. Yeah, it's exactly
what it's doing. All right. So while
I does this thing, I'm going to jump
back here for a sec, and I'm going
to use Cloud Code Standard, and I'm
going to say update. I got to type it
right. Update the, where did we
run that again? I'm going to stop
that for a sec. I'm going to give it
the exact address. So here. I don't need this
one. This looks like a one update to
include a new clod flow page on left and a
nav that uses the following command to
interact, I guess, interact and display
the resources. Ruben, you're
just using the standard cloud
right now, right? No, I'm using cloud flow. This is flow, okay.
Yeah, so just as an FYI, you don't have
to use the Claude-flow CLI or the CLI. All
you need to do to use Claude-flow is type
Cloud and then use the dangerously skipped
permission option here. And then what you
have here when you do that is
when you see slash, you get
all my commands, right? So you get
all the various commands. So if I type
GitHub, you get my GitHub commands.
If I type Spark, you get my Spark
commands, right? So I don't need to
invoke it using the Claude-flow CLI. I
just use it this way. And if I don't do anything,
it's automatically getting my clod.md
file, right? So it already knows how to
use my system because I've already put it
in the clod.md file. This is telling it
how it needs to work. So the Claude-flow
at alpha but is mostly for cloud
code to know how to interact with
it using the MPX. All right. So
let's jump back here. We're
back. This one. All right. So it's
just consuming tokens out of the
system prompt. Yes, it is. And I think it's the
first time it runs. So back to the,
you know, let's just check this
for a moment. This is still going. Every time you open
up a new terminal, are you having, are you
having to re like initiate the cloud flow in
that terminal or is it already no no it's all
i occasionally update it well this you're
looking at actually the environment that i have
to do my cloud flow development but assuming
this was not that environment i would i
would need to probably reinstantiate it
if i know there's a new update but you
automatically get that because i'm
using the mpx which will give you the
most recent alpha version if you use
the at alpha tag gotcha so go ahead
the npx the uh so the way i do is claw dangerous
escape permissions first so they're
Claude um the normal you know typing window
comes in and then i generally run the npx
command with force function to create all
the folder structures on the terminal so
you are saying that uh you know that that's
what creates all of the files right all
the folder structures exactly so once you do
it you know once you do it once you probably
don't have to do it again unless there's
an error but there's uh sometimes there's
a uh like they changed for example last
week they changed the structure for how the
um the settings.json worked so i had to
basically reinstantiate that which made
that error go away i don't know why they
they changed it and you know two weeks after
launching it but anyway that's what they did
so i had to go and fix that and
reinstantiated for all the things I had previously
run the in it on so now I'm what I'm
doing is I'm giving an example so I'm gonna go
here and I go back and I think it's which
one is it I don't even know now to go back
let's scroll back up oh it's still still
building but you can see here I'm this output
is working in exactly the same way so i'm
gonna i'm gonna go back here and i'm gonna
say make sure to parse parse the uh sorry
guys i'm getting a bit of uh there we go
so i'm just telling them to parse the
json correctly in the web ui and then
i've got to go and i've got to figure
out which one of my things I just made
actually does that. So I'm just going to create a new file quick. New file. All right. Pop
that in here. Oops. Was it this one? Yeah. This one will give
it a good example. Get rid of that. Here's an example. What? And now, you
know, you can also change the mode,
but I think it's control.
What's the control? No, I always forget.
There's a control mode that lets you
go to planning mode. You guys remember
what the control for changing between
planning mode is? Command, tab, tab. Okay. Yeah, I'm not
going to do it right now because I don't want
to get stuck in that mode. But I could do
planning mode here. not going to bother all
right pasted that in i'm in the agentic
flow that's good so now what i'm
gonna so well just to recap what i'm doing
so while that bakes what i'm attempting
to do here is create a new section along
the side here which will be like a clod
flow which basically will will make this
more pretty and show it in the ui similar what
i'm doing in these with these you you
know user interfaces i don't think this is
actually running at the moment no i
think i turned it off yeah i turned it off
let me run that again run start so this is
all using web so at the very least what i'm
doing here which is useful for you guys is
i'm actually i've created a mechanism that
allows me to interact with um cloud code through
web, web, web hooks, web, web sockets. So
if you want to use that as part of some
secondary application, you want to have
additional sort of swarm capabilities or whatever
it is you want to do. This is, this
is meant to just show how to do it.
So I did it in a crazy sort of a
1980s, you know, hacker style, but you
can basically use my, my web hooks to integrate
this to whatever application you want
and this is just a nice quick example
of how to do that and you're saying that
you're saying that this is swarm as a service
basically but yeah so that's exactly what
it's warm as a service you can see that i've
exposed them using in this case local
local you know urls but you this could be
whatever.com i don't have any security on it
currently so you know secure it so this
this is on this isn't running publicly this
is on a local host So if you do want to
run this as a service somewhere else, then
you're going to want to add auth to it. I
haven't gotten there yet. But you can see here's how it's interacting. Here's
initialization. I've got Mastra integration. Studio. This isn't a major
error. This means that it already started
the server, and it's getting an error so it
doesn't need to start it again. I might
give it more elegant server already started message rather
than an error. Let's go back here. All right, so now
I'm going to create a new Claude-flow
component, update the navigation
and modify that. All right, while
we do that, I am going to try
something else. Let's go to the end here. Hold on. Do I have open code in this one? Yeah, I do. So this is something
else I've been looking at.
OpenCode, is anyone on the call familiar
with OpenCode? Well, OpenCode is
basically a sort of open source version.
You can call it the version of CloudCode,
similar in structure. I've been looking
at OpenCode, Reuven, and it's
pretty unstable and raw at the
moment, man. Yeah, that's
my specialty. yeah i like it
yeah you're a good you're a good
match for uh for open code at the
moment for sure yeah yeah but i i i
100 agree i i tried it earlier um it's i
i wasn't see how it defaults to github
copilot 4.1 which is the free which is cool
because it's free but i i can't for the
life of me get it to switch to you know use
my uh my sonic account all right so now
it's initializing and And that's actually
weird because that's one of the fundamental
design principles of OpenCode is to
have as many back-end models configurable
as you possibly can. Well, I can't
figure it out. But the most useful
part of OpenCode is – so I'm just initializing
it right now. It's cool that it's free.
I love the fact that it's free. So if there
was ever a fallback, it's a good one. um so
now it's it's looking at the environment
it's creating the uh cloud code all right
so update the what do they call that file and
how do you scroll up there's no obvious
way to scroll either i don't i don't know
it's it's broken in many ways this thing but
it has potential one sorry for interrupting
um you are using the the wrong um open code
there are two versions ah that's true there
are two and and and you must use the sst open
code um there are also the owner of opencode
.ai um and this is really a beautiful tool
all right let's let's let's use the right
one the other one is bought from a company um
the developer and there was some issues i
don't know actually i'm gonna before i do i'm
just gonna remove yeah i'm gonna remove that
so i'm gonna flood dangerously skip i'm
gonna call out and remove open code you're right
that's exactly what i did i'm like this looked
different last week that explains it all
right i think it's this is t1 right yeah
open code mpm and all files all right let's
let's go use the right let's go use the right
one open code there's two like results here
and i think i gotta do it i think i gotta do
a uh this sst yeah what what a what a terrible
name like call it yeah there's some
issues about the the the trademarks and things
like that but um in the end a better developer
behind open code is this one okay that
explains i'm like this i swear this looked different
last week yeah i i uh i installed the other
one that if this is also an npm mind you
just uses a different looks like they're
they're using dash ai oh just
just to make it uh just to
make it confusing all right let's
go back let's split two for
cloud code i guess someone took the
original anthropic all right so i'm
gonna clean that up let's take a look
what's going on here all right so this
is working so or let's see how bad
i broke it let's go back i'm doing
i'm doing multiple things at the same
time here oops where did i put
that over here no that's not it maybe i closed it that's okay i'll
restart it I've got it so it auto
I've got too many windows open open
browser all right now we've got a cloud
flow section all right test the concurrent
let's see see how quickly I was able to do that
well it's probably gonna break but we'll
see it is once you've got a template in
place it's pretty it's pretty fast all right
look that looks good um climate moment is
it is it gonna work now i get i get
unknown message heartbeat it doesn't
look like it's working for some reason
terminal connected um not getting i'm not getting a response okay one second i'm
now we're gonna go back here i'm I'm
doing two things at once here, but
that's the fun part. All right. Did it
get rid of the open code? Okay. So now
I'm going to go back. And this time I'm
going to get it to open code SST. Is that what
it was? Yeah. This one is the SST
version. So it actually confuses everybody
about. Well, the worst part is I actually was
using the other version last week. and today
i'm like oh they must have updated their
ui no it's just the wrong **** version
yeah and i actually think there's some
issue with it kind of being hacked or
something as well and and dangerous or something
so you kind of got to be careful there's
something going on between these two
competing orgs long story short there are um where
two main developers um that are reaching
the pro of the first project um and the
the guy who was inventing the the repo
at the first time, was hired from another
company for big money. And now the two
guys who are made a lot of code for
the alpha versions, they have the
domain open code.ai and also the repo.
And there are the better developers,
as I have seen. And so they have a
little bit struggle about naming and
things and contracts and things like
that. But in the end, SST open code,
easy to remind. Okay. So I'm going to go
here and I'm going to tell to install
the right one. All right. Let's go
ahead and do that. And now while that
does that, I'm going to jump back here and see
what this is doing. I didn't see an output,
which indicates it just wasn't returning
the output correctly. But the UI looked good. So that's good news. So basically what I'm
doing is I'm attempting to create a, using
the streaming output from claude
code i want to output that into the ui then
i want to sort of take that output and
clean it up and make it pretty and show the
various integrations so i want to bypass
the traditional ui make my own so it
doesn't do all that flickering and all
that other crazy stuff so i want to i
want to be able to parse the tasks and
the to-dos and and the responses and
then segment those, basically recreate
the sort of general flow and vibe of
Claude code, but do it in this kind
of retro style UI. That's my idea.
How come you have the HTML inspect
window open? This tells me
what's happening. Yeah, I know what
it is. I'm just wondering what you're
doing with it. So when I start, so a lot
of what, especially when you're doing a
front-end website, and I'm using
WebSockets here, you're going to see
a few things. And so let me refresh the
page for a moment. So you see here, I
initialize it. And then we see here,
there's the initial socket. That's always
gonna fail because it takes a second for
the server to start. I probably need to
do that differently. Then what I'm doing
is I'm connecting to my real-time
synchronization, which you see here as use
real-time sync. And then I'm using an
auto-connect every three seconds, I
guess, or 30 seconds. And then I'm connecting
to the router. so this is giving me
the general idea of what's happening right
so as I do things I can always see exactly how
it works here now the so the other thing
I'm doing is I'm going to copy if I'm running
into an error I'm just going to copy and
paste the stuff that cloud code can't see
in the in the UI now I could probably use
something like what's the tool the playwright to
do this as well if I wanted to I'm lazy right
now I didn't bother installing playwright
but playwright would essentially automate
this a bit for me but I'd actually when it
comes to UI I don't mind actually doing it so
right so when I go to mcb tools you can see
here it's it's always show I'm getting an
error here what's what's this one okay this
is this is a good example so it looks like
I'm getting a web socket error but this that
might because it's currently working so I'm
just going to go back and see what it's
actually doing it looks like it might have
broke the web socket it. So I'm going to
go back here. And I'm going to stop it. I generally don't have
to restart it. But sometimes if it
changes the WebSocket server, I'm going to
have to restart it. So again, I'm showing a
verbose output here as well. I'm always
curious what the heck it's doing and how
and how it's doing it. And we're going to go
back here. I'm going to refresh it those
logs automatically get saved somewhere in your
memory or like no no they don't um i do
well yes sort of well yeah you mean the inspect
window logs console logs alexander the
console i know but no they don't i've got
logs that i'm storing in in in here as well i
think it'd be super interesting to like take
this community's like logs like do some data
analysis on it parse it and like kind of
get a sense of like what the what a successful
projects like cadence would be in terms
of like how we're prompting it to get to
like a completed outcome well ui stuff is always
the trickiest because it requires kind of
iteration back and forth see how i'm i'm
pasting the that it broke the uh the web's
socket so now i gotta tell it how it broken
it will it if you know the middleware is
easier because it's more kind of iterative back
and forth this is you know it doesn't see
the things it doesn't see uh what's the file
with that one I mean a screenshot of a UI
we can upload that and send it where this
prompt but is it possible I'm not sure I
understand your question I mean you know this one
is not exactly seeing the UI so maybe we
can have a screenshot and send it through
via prompt but if it is possible the the issue
isn't isn't visually the screen look it
looks fine right i it's loading correctly the
issue here is is uh you know kind of
hidden from from view that's why i
have the console open it's basically
not connect dev tools back into
a log file that's accessible from cloud
code so you can at least yeah i could
totally do that i could save it to a
sqlite or something and then just tell it
to review that or i could send it directly
back to uh right here right and show
it and show it on in this area i
could i suppose you know i'm
just i'm kind of winging it a
little bit today but that's what that's
what this is doing that's your style
man yeah i'm i'm vibing it what can i
say it's this doesn't look like a major
issue but it looks like and now they're
ready a simple test it so it's going to
write a little test script to figure out
what the issue is all right update
the components let it create a
mock clod script for testing purposes oh i don't like mock
but we'll see so it's simula oh it's doing two different things here okay i see the
i see the issue let's go back
here for a second um i noticed that every
time i use cloud i don't know if it's
cloud or if there's the swarm but it's always
trying to make mock uh or simulations to try
to fake results i don't know why i keep first
i keep pushing back i keep pushing back
like you are you gotta mock it before you
create it that's my spark methodology if if
you're trying to build before you know what
you're building it's going to fail and go down
a rabbit hole of just constant errors so
when you use spark the first step is to create
a pseudo code outline and mocks of of the
structure using a test driven development
approach that means it's working correctly the
part that that you need to watch out for
is after all your mocks are are complete you
need to make sure that the system has gone
from a mock version of it to a functional
version but if you're trying to skip the
testing phase then you're gonna have a lot of
problems i will say that it's pretty good the
mocks that it does are pretty good at faking
you out i get caught all the time like oh
it's working but then i realized oh it's just
the box yes yeah but sometimes sometimes
doesn't catch uh all of them so it keeps it fix
most of them but then they have a couple of
things going around in mark or in the
simulations so it's hard to get it yeah oh i
agree um come on cli it is installed on the
on this point about uh basically test-driven
development right in when we went in group
code world i used to like in my prompt specifically
say follow the ddd method london
school and write tests before you write a code
in cloud flow generally and i could see all
the test cases created first before it built
but in the cloud flow bed i don't see the
test cases created is that because do we have
to specifically mention that in the cloud.md
or or do you do yes unless you're vibing
you don't care you need to tell it what it
needs to do it's not gonna it's not gonna
magically know what you want to build so in
your you know out of the box cloud.md basically
it's not there is what i'm presuming
uh i'm not sure i understand your question
He's referring to the Spark methodology,
Reuven, which has the TDD built into it and the
pseudocode mode phase of it. He's just
wondering, is that Spark methodology integrated
into Flow or not? It is integrated
into Flow. I'm just not sure
if I understand exactly what
you're asking. so so basically in
when we were doing in drew code i would in
my prom specifically say that use for
example test driven development approach
london school write test before you develop
anything you know follow that methodology so
you don't have it would write all the
test cases first feature by feature and then
build now when i use for example swarm or
hive mind I generally have a PRD and I
ask it, here is the PRD, here are all the
specs, now build it. So it does build
it, it mocks things up and it works,
but I don't see it writing the
test cases per se. I'm wondering,
that's because maybe I need to
explicitly ask even when I am
writing the PRD, that write test
cases before you develop and
follow Spark. Yeah, it depends
on which command you're using,
but it sounds like you're on
the right track. If you don't define
your test, your unit tests or testing
strategy in your PRD, there's a high likelihood
it will either skip it or use a rudimentary
implementation. Now, I've got that in the slash spark command. So there's a, well,
I had to restart my code space.
I crashed here, but I'll show you
that in a moment. So I attempted
to paste too much and then crash
the terminal. So we're going to
go back here for a moment and hopefully
this restarts here. But you've got in
this folder here, and you see the commands? You've got a folder,
you've got all the commands, you just
got to use them. You have to invoke
the Spark commands. So for example,
you've got TDD here. So this would be
the test-driven development
command, right? This tells it how it
needs to use it. These are your various
commands. These are your
viewers, your MCP integrations. So you
can invoke all those. Now, why isn't my
terminal loading? so is is hive calling
spark tdd no you are you're still doing
all this manually well it could it
could if you update your cloud.md file
so the first thing i do is i update
this cloud md file this one here uh
to be specific to the project in
which i'm working on so in your case you
know so this the one you get by default is
is is generic right it's it's saying
here's here's how the swarm needs to work
but it's not really doing anything uh you
know specific like if you want spark you
might you probably need to add that as
as more directions so you can customize
this a bit now i have no idea when my terminal
is not working do you manually edit your
CloudMD or do you just copy in a template
that you you woo that you're you I depending
what depending what I'm doing I'll I'll manage
it I'm not sure why my terminal stopped
working yeah man your icons are not refreshing
in the little shell so idea yeah that you
got some problems there yeah I'm not sure
what's going on here uh close remote connection
i might reload the developer uh window
with the command palette the command palette
isn't loading oh really i guess it's time to
just turn it off and turn it on i i already
did that uh reese yeah reload window
maybe yes i tried that usually that that's
enough to code restart to update code container
compose restart um which one is it
there's a there's a a lot or code space i don't want to
rebuild the container that seems a little
dramatic connect to code space i gotta tell you
i i hate reloading rebuilding the
container in code spaces because if it fails
your your code space boots into like a
recovery mode and then you gotta fix it yeah
well i've got all the data it's not it's
not that big a deal i've been but it's
persistent yeah it's just it's just uh
i'm gonna try i'm gonna try one more
close remote connection it's weird i i don't
i don't know why it i haven't seen this before
of course it's it's only going to happen
on a live broadcast. But here, we're going to see what we can do here. So before I go, I'm going to attempt to restart it. So you guys get to
watch that for a moment. So we're going to go
to GitHub Codespaces. Oops. Bit of a delay there. and I'm gonna see if
I can just restart the machine itself
where's my cloud flow right here and
stop code space to which what was the name
of that one I might had more
than one running. Refactored carnival? Refactored carnival. All right, let's
give that a go. Otherwise, I might need a more drastic approach or I might need, you know, what I might
need, actually, you know what I might
need to do? If it doesn't work, it's
probably not the code space. It's probably
via, I probably need to kill VS code. I probably
over, I'd probably that some sort of
overflow when i try to copy and paste all
that uh json we'll give that one more try
yeah you guys get to watch me debug i guess
if that's exciting i was waiting i have a
question that worked all right so so yeah
go ahead one thing note when you when
you're when you're recovering you can
always do dash c looks like i looks like
the restart worked so what was sorry what
was your question um i was curious
about the sequence of commands that
you explicitly um basically ask at the
beginning like during the flow so the previous
question was about explicitly calling
tdt as spark tdt um so i'm curious what's your
standard sequence of comments like spark
researcher and then spark studio code or then
spark tdd what's the sequence that you usually
recommend to follow so it it depends what
i'm doing and i'm not sure why this is
taking so long to start but i'll show you here
in a sec uh let's see here let's see another
plot and you see what's going on there that's
that's working oops wants to do that
roof i think this is a great question
um the way i i'm still getting used
to the whole swarm and i've been using
it for a few things but emmanuel like
the way i do is prd first then i say
to plot of plot flow basically um you know
this is the prd what do you recommend what
what what structure of agents number of agents
you recommend provide me full commands how
I proceed so then it tells me this is
how it is I initializes the swarm right and
then once it does that then I say okay go and
build it I think what I have not been doing
is as roof pointed out is because I would
prefer to do it through a TDD approach so I
should actually go into the cloud that
MD file and say follow maybe I need to put a
line in there to say follow tdd approach
spark but i guess your questions about
researcher and all of this stuff uh yeah i would
love you know prove your your inputs will be
welcome like how you know i think i guess
so you've got you've got different you've got
different modes right and those and those
modes can be invoked either through
programmatic means or often just you doing it so
in this case when you do slash and we do spark
you'll see that i've got different spark
modes i could ask you know i get integration
i got optimizer devops reviewer re you
know my here's my super base admin coders so
this is using sort of my my preferred approach
right so i've got so tdd obviously
would be td and i just did that up here so
in this case i told i basically said to
add the tdd components to my claw.md file
so now when i when i reinstantiate it's
going to have the tdd components included
automatically so here we go so now we
see here it's it's decided you know
i'll go here and i'll find it tdd so this
is how it's going to orchestrate the tdd
components and get it gives it more guidance
how to refactor how to do you know tdd
swarm roles for that so i've just given
i i've given it more guidance on how the
agents need to interact with when doing tdd based
components so i know there's a lot and i'm
what i'm trying to do here is not give
you everything because if i gave you everything
then it would just do nothing particularly
well so i'm i'm invoking certain things
at certain points when i need them and now
as part of the initial sort of guidance what
i might do is i might go with a research mode,
like Swarm Research or something, and I
might say, include a TDD-driven approach
using Spark or something, and it'll know to
include that as well. So I'm guiding it.
I'm the engineer here. Today I'm vibing a
little bit, but generally speaking, as an
engineer, your job is to provide guidance in
terms of architecture, in terms of
procedures and process and data
and whatever. Without that,
you're just vibing. I had an observation,
I've been noticing a lot of creativity,
you know, from yourself and from others
coming through and in the sort of these
techniques and workflows and updates people are
making and customising their Claude.md
to get sort of the workflow that you
that you desire. And I wonder if there's an
opportunity to maybe kind of optimize the
updates to Claude.md and maybe some kind
of management layer for how to better work
with the Claude.md. You mean like to
have a repo where everybody can dump
their Claude.md versions in there somehow?
Well, potentially this, yeah, like a
kind of a best practice library for cloud
.md customizations, but then also an
injection method for how to actually
update it dynamically. And prompt cloud code. Yeah, for sure. sure
but he was just like yeah but like leveraging
all this best practice and doing it in a
programmatic way that and that can be done
you know i want that one now or now i'm switching
to that one kind of thing or it could
also be something like md actually it could
just pull from a github repo right we could
all just dump our mds into a github repo and
then and then you It could just say, find
the best Claude.md for this problem that I'm
looking for right now, and it will go out to
that Claude.md repo and the Agentex repo
and find it, scan it, find it, and then say,
here, I found it. Do you want me to push it
right now to your M&D? Yeah. yeah or another idea
is like if we point it to the code modules
folder Claude basically and say you know i'm
going to solve this problem and i want to
do this kind of approach as some kind of user
prompt can you kind of look at those modules
and update the cloud on md file suitably
before i initiate this swarm right yeah exactly
that's that's exactly what i was thinking
more of a modular way like i like that
chunk not not to replace the whole thing but
just just pieces but in that case we can
create like a gpt so it would be expert on
creating cloud mds and then you just describe exactly
what's the project and they would create
it perfectly yeah but you but you want
you want the benefit you want to benefit from
everybody's Claude md file to find the
best one not not just scanning your code you're
also constrained by the context window so
you need to be yeah you need to optimize
what elements or what features you want to
curate into your cloud md could we use the
switches maybe for this would that be useful
the slash commands yeah yeah the slash
commands are generally geared towards human
interaction yeah where where the clod the
doc clod file is kind of the default guidance
so the suggestion to have different
clod mds is actually a really good one
because that's really what this is the most
important file this tells it how everything
else needs to work yeah i think it only
reads it i think it reads it when it
boots when it boots up right i don't
know if you can refresh the clod md it
can refresh the clod md but more what
i've been doing is launching Claude code
from within different folders so that they
reference different Claude MD files and then
have them effectively work on separate
areas of the code. I think... Opinionated
best practices. Yeah, I discovered that it
does that by accident. I think that happens
automatically now, Jed, if I'm not mistaken. So when it goes into a directory to do work, it's going to
check and see what the closest
ClaudeMD file is. So ClaudeMD files
actually stack with increasing specificity
depending on how deep into the
code base you are. Actually, I think
you're right, Rob. But I think
that... Sorry? So if I have a ClaudeMD
in a subfolder, does ClaudeCode
only pay attention to that ClaudeMD
file? No, it stacks. It stacks. yeah
it's in the documentation actually
yeah it stacks so the idea of like
toggling between planning mode testing
mode development mode in in a series of
cloud md files is is an interesting one i
don't know how you'd accomplish it but but
yeah they stack and then that way you can
have a cloud md file specific to a subfolder
but i don't think that's a new feature
rob i think that's been around for a while
because i remember reading that way back uh like
a couple months ago yeah yeah see there's
another way to think about these are all
really good suggestions by the way the other
option you guys can think about and
this is something i've been looking at um is
the settings.json file so these are really
interesting because you they are hooks
that execute you know before after and during
the execution of various tools right so you
can see that i'm using it here as part of
the you know i'm using basically bash it
was and i can use my mpx and then i'm using
that and then i'm inserting dynamic
information as part of that into my my mpx commands
and now i didn't bother with with with
the mcp because oops did i just break it
there we go because um I know this works and
I'm working in this case I'm working in the
environment that I'm actually building Claude
Flow in so I can't recursively work on the
tool that I'm building because it will break
frequently so to get around that I'm
using the mpx as a remote instantiation so I'm
essentially using the last version that
worked and then and I'm calling that mpx in
this you know in this case you know pre-tool
use whenever write edit multi-edit is called
then you're gonna you're going to do this
command. Now I can do that for lots of things.
For example, let's say every time I do a
certain command like post tool, I might want
to update my GitHub and do a stash. And
then what that would allow me to do is roll
back at any point as the system executes. So
I'm basically creating checkpoints at every
point along the way. I'm not doing that
here because it's a bit much, but
I could do that. You can see here I've
got different matchers for write, edit,
and multi-edit now i could take this further
and i could i could add it to like the
to-dos and and tasks and stuff like that
and then when it ends it does this last
session basically closes the session itself
and this is all being stored to the swarm
environment and and then i'm enabling my mcp
servers as well the roof flow and and roof
swarm components but there's a lot of opportunity
in in this particular file and i'm giving
you a generic sort of initial one but you
could you could fool around with that
let's see what else we got here what's i'm
still trying to get the the stream the output
i'm not sure what it's doing here i hate this
flickering thing i wish they would fix
this it's so annoying and it gets worse as
long the further you go I don't think it's
done. I think it's still looks like
it's working. I don't think this has been
implemented yet. The debug adds.
So when I click the debug button,
you see here, I've got different
debug information, sending ping, so
I'm just iteratively sort of doing
it step by step. but it looks
like everything's other than oh this
one's still giving me an error i'll
fix that later let's see if this
actually how bad how bad that it how
bad i broke that no not bad it's
a minor error so this is basically
in this case i just executed that particular
feature which are all the other
features i showed you i'm just giving you
i'm basically giving you guys a way to
interact with the swarm through a website
that's really all that's really all i
was trying to show you guys how to do here
once you give up give up on the open
code uh demo or eval uh well i crashed
when i was and i got sidetracked uh let's go
let's go back here uh install i'm going to
tell it to install the right one this
time if i can find it this this one there we go yeah so note
to self two different open code projects that
basically do exactly the same thing in
completely different ways which is a little
annoying all right i've successfully updated
the You'll be properly handled with Jason's
streaming events. All right, let's
go back there and see what
that looks like. No, it's doing
the wrong command. Quick question for you,
Reuben. How's things coming with Mesh?
Is Mesh done, or are you still hacking on
it? Well, I've been on a little bit of vacation,
and my wife told me I wasn't allowed to
turn on my computer. I'm not pressuring
you, man. I just wondered. I know that one. yeah
she was not keen on me uh you know sitting
in front of my computer at the cottage so uh
yeah i i i haven't been as productive i've
been pretty productive just not as productive
as i usually am no pressure man i'm
just i'm just wondering david you seem like
identification now what's that nursing
uh the dave gratton i think you seem like
navigation with your hawaii t-shirt a hawaii
shirt and everything briefly came on the
camera yeah i should i should have wore my
hawaii shirt yeah i'm at the cottage so um
i am indeed outside next to the lake so yes
it's oh yeah oh there we go yeah he said
that's is that is that hawaiian or canadian
tropics uh this is dominican republic
but um no i'm i'm just by i'm just up in the
muskocas so which is which i like to call
the canadian tropics oh well it feels pretty
tropical right now i can tell you that
much yeah i don't know if that's a thing um
i i might have just invented that as a thing
at some point there was certainly tropics
right yes 250 million years ago there was
a tropical sea in this general area of
canada but uh that was a lot where are you
typically martin where are you um i'm um port
seven that kind of area if you know i'll
see if i can give you a um i'm from Panatang
originally, just around the corner.
Yeah, just around the corner. Do you imagine
it's a six-mile lake? There you go. Nice. Down there. How
big is the lake? I'm going to
say six miles. It's not about the size of the lake, Reuven. What's that in Canadian? That's got to be like
about 10 kilometers. Have you got your
cycle? Are you going to go biking again? You're
enjoying your bike rides? Oh, yeah. I've
just gotten into this whole cycle cycling
craziness i'm i'm going on a um big cycle group
with uh the toronto biking network it's
going to be like four days of any length of
journey you want so i did myself nuts the
other day i um i usually i indoor bike that's
my thing if i would do about 50 kilometers
in the morning i watch youtube and all the
rest of it and i post all my stuff to strava
my my friend he goes ah you're missing it
you're missing it all like indoor cycling
that's a three outdoor cycling that's a 10
you got to do it so he he made me cycle 110
kilometers once i was halfway there i was
committed i couldn't just get off and there
was a big meal at the end of it so um yeah
and now i'm doing this this thing over in
peterborough so prove it's it's an option
you don't just have to indoor cycle my my
exercise bike broke this morning so now i i
might have to go outside right yeah come to
peterborough that might be much sure um Reuven
i've got a bit of an update on synaptic mesh
if you want sure yeah good to see chris um
you'll have to apologize um for the robe um
it is five o'clock in the morning here in
new zealand and cool uh i'm trying to
share the host is not allowing sharing can
the host please sharing yeah that that was thanks
to our our our last uh yep quick on the
buttons yeah how do i make just one person
be able to share let's see here allow you
can't just make i okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
allow share okay you requested there you
go i was worried that there might be some like
craziness as of last week my apologies on
that too by the way yeah i've been looking
into settings i'll update you later i
figured i figured out i turned it off well
that's one way but you can also stop you don't
have to let everybody share at the same
time you basically say that if someone's
sharing no one else can share and also you can
turn off the um the scribble thing which
was the first instant. So here we are. I
don't know if you if you remember and
some of you might not have been on the
call but a couple of weeks back I
shared this mock -up of a what a swarm
might look like and none of it's real
and on the call Reuven said oh well you've
done the front end I've got the backing for
you and so that's where he introduced me to
synaptic mesh um i don't really know what this
does Reuven um do you but synaptic mesh well
it's my attempt to share compute capacity
based on several other projects i've created
but it's it's very generally the your idea
around uh yeah sharing cloud exactly so so
then um what i did was um very crudely um
attempted to brute force the inclusion
of synaptic mesh into the search
for the artificial super intelligence
mock-up and it proceeded
proceeded to i let it cook
overnight and i returned to 120
000 lines of code um it got very very
busy it did a lot of stuff um none of it
really worked a lot of it i don't know um so
basically i then tried to recover from that
by um giving it a bit of structure and so
i invented this um customizations i called
the yolo protocols and essentially what that's
doing is it's just giving instructions to
call.md to how to do the the work chunking
and the GitHub issues. So, you know, create
the epic, create the feature, create the
the stories, so to speak, and make sure
they're all linked. Make sure that you
only deliver based on those things and then
close them as you go. And it was it was very
effective and, you know, structuring
the work. so you know essentially did a
review of of of the code base and then
said right based on um where we need
to go now let's plan forward and
and so that's where all these
issues started up um and then you
know it's again been very busy
it's it's we've got 45 closed
issues in here uh i'm showing you all
of the the admin um you should you see
it yeah that's it you do okay one sec sorry
um cool um so so i'm showing you all the all
the busy work um did it do anything well
what it did do is it created a new component
for roof fan called neural bridge i don't
know what the **** it is um i don't know
what it is but i love it it's a high
performance wasm neural network library with
samd acceleration and real-time monitoring um
anyway i've i've i've linked that to an issue
on the on the roof fan um github repo
um so you can take a look and see if that's
worth including and again not really sure
what it's doing it thought it needed to
optimize something in the process what's so can
you run it uh i don't i don't know if
you can just run it straight off the bat or
if it needs some other stuff again um not
not really too sure um have you talked to
claude code about it have you like have you
like at least like put it in the like try to
run it or like kind of ask like what what
exactly are you doing i i tried that i
couldn't understand it it's it's explain to
me like like i'm a like a 15 year old or
something is what i so this is reaching that
that edge here where ai we just are not
going to understand everything that's going
on this is like kind of like starting to
emerge so it's it's kind of the the ADHD brain
just moved me to other other tasks so
I got going with other things but anyway did
some pretty cool things in the meantime I
was trying to get the authentication working
so sorry I'm jumping around a little bit
the first feature I asked it to do was
well actually let's get the Claude max authentication
working because on the front page
hopefully this works on the front page the
idea is that you come in here and you
connect your Claude Max account and then if
everyone comes in and connects their Claude
Max accounts then we can kind of contribute
to the mega swarm and then we can all kind of
work on sorry if we're repeating because we
did this the other week but you know you'd
have your projects in here and I could
add my github repo you could add yours and we
could kind of vote on which tasks we wanted
to to get done together and as part of that
that mega swarm activity and some features
that it added since the other week was
that it added mcp tools so it's got the Claude
flow mcp server and some of those tools
are there and then you can come in and come
in and push buttons and do stuff it's probably
just a mock i don't really know what it's
doing but yeah it was it was a wild it was
a wild west cowboy attempt at trying to
do some kind of a merge and it was a fun learning
exercise um that's that's how i would
put it nice i like the ui i'm sure we could
get it get it working well i think i
think uh you've you've probably
leapfrogged with with your with
your fancy new CRT-inspired UI, Ruth?
No, no, no. To be honest, the UI is more
about the WebSockets and how you actually
interact with it than it is the
graphical components. Now that I've
got WebSockets, you can basically
just use my example and say
make mine work. By the way, I've
been able to get the other version
of OpenCode working, so I'm going to
attempt to log in. and anthropic I guess
clod max and let's see what happens
here explains why it worked last week and
suddenly look totally different sweet guys
wasn't my brain wasn't fully functioning
earlier all right so I'm gonna log in to
my clod and authorize that and I'm gonna
copy my code go back many times someone
else says when we go to this code
thing right it defaults a local host
callback function sometimes like I'm
authenticating with a subscription from
a code space it goes back to local
host and do a few times it works it's
just quite strange yeah that's that
only happens when it uses the
OAuth component how do you not use it sorry I'll
look it up next Yeah, you can, there's
an option when you log in that someone says
Claude Max or Claude Max or something, and
the other says API. Oh, okay. Thank you. The current
research agents? I don't even know. And this is talking to Claude Flo as
well right now? API bad root. No, open code. Are
we in open code right now? Is this
open code? Yeah. So OpenCode's main
feature, Alex, is that they wanted a coding
system that kind of is similar to
ClaudeCode, but you have complete control on
the back end of what models you want to use
and how many models you want to use and
how you switch between those models. It's
a multi-model back end system, whereas
ClaudeCode is one model, right? It took a
couple of models, Opus and Sonnet, but it's
tied to Anthropic. What's that? it's clod
code meets open router like in the term in
your cli basically yes it's it's basically
open router behind clod code and you're not
tied to anyone's subscription or a key or
or anything but spawn but spawn is a is a clod
flow you know kind of concept at this point
i mean is open code also spawning up
multiple agents you mean swarms no i mean you i
mean i guess rube just used the word spawn I
wasn't sure if that was a command that you
were using Groove well Claude code has this um
this concept of batch mode right you can
batch batch the batch command allows you
this the hidden command that they took out of
the documentation that allows you to just spawn
off as many parallel instances of Claude
and that's native to to Claude that's we
didn't know what nobody coded that into Claude
that's just part of it but we discovered
that they removed that from their documentation
because they kind of, I guess they don't
want people to do that. But they left it
as a capability. The batch feature, you know, Ruben,
earlier on, Ruben just mentioned
that, you know, or maybe it was another
meeting, that the previous systems
like Rue code, for example, is very
serialized. You can't, you can't, it does all
its work serialized. But with the batch
command with Claude, you can parallelize work
by just spawning off agents one after the
after the other and batch them off i'll let
you you you got a much better explanation on
that uh reuben you've done a lot of work
on that i don't know i'm i i'm logging
into logging into uh anthropic made the whole
thing stop working oh yeah it's this thing
is a little bit kludgy it's got a
great concept but uh i don't know
how well they're actually making it
work yet see i'm getting now i'm
getting this api this i don't know what
this error is i logged in and it
stopped working conceptually it's good yeah but it don't work
i i don't know too many people that
actually have it working anyone on the call
to make it work as soon as i added as soon
as i added anthropic it stopped working
and now i logged out and if i remember
correctly open code uses the open ai
api library not the anthropic api library
well i have that right here but it
doesn't seem to want to use it now let's
see if i can just go here and see what's
going on nothing i'm sure someone can
uh demo their working instance at
tomorrow's uh well it worked for about two
seconds but then i went and added anthropic
and it stopped working now i might
be able to log back in see maybe it's one
of those login twice to give it let's
try this one i think i'm already
logged into that yeah but it
doesn't have the oaf token in that session I think it's working
on my machine, so I don't know. Maybe it doesn't work
with Codespaces. I can't see why it works with Codespaces
to GitHub. Let's just give
it one more. Let's give it
one more go. Yeah, I'm still getting the request of models. That's a different error. Yeah. Maybe I just have
the model, but yes. I have models.
I think it's just using the
wrong model. Yeah, you can do slash models when it's running. And we'll choose that. I guess they added so
much more recently. how do i choose the
model model i think if you just do open
code and then when you're in the interface
you can do slash models i don't know
if you uh how to do it yeah you can
do slash models see it's only seeing like
the copilot models but not the entropic so
maybe that's the issue Yeah. I think it's worth it. All right. Uh, run to agents. I'm currently, I'll figure it out. I'm,
I'm persistent. And it's able to do
that because it's looking at your
cloud.md file, right? I haven't gotten that
far yet. I'm just using open code. I'm not
sure what it's looking at, but it looks
like it's running to look. so it does do two
that's cool it's not flickering okay let's
try another let's go here i'm gonna let
that do its thing so you you've configured
it to use um but it's not using your Claude
mac subscription right it's using the api
direct yeah i'm still getting the error
here oh i just jinxed All right. Well, the concurrent
works from here. I think I know the
issue. I don't think it likes, I think it
needs to be GPT-4.1. Okay. Let's go back here. And we'll go back
here for a moment then we'll do slash
models oh uh let's let's try i i think
maybe the entropic subscription
didn't go cool or something no i realized
you only oh okay uh bottles all right
then this time i'm gonna do slash m and
i'm gonna choose the one i know works which
is this one there we go i'm cooking
all right that's what i wanted okay so what
i wanted to do was be able to invoke
open code through the command line similar
what i was doing with the stream but i don't
i use other models so now i'm gonna
see i'm gonna see uh I'll figure it out. There we go.
Invalid, oh, I'm getting the
invalid thing. Descript you are
first agent of two. Invalid tool input. Not sure what that means. are you sure that gpt
4.1 is good and in two links and calling
no i'm not that's maybe the problem let's
try it how does it know to run npx cord
flow alpha when you didn't you didn't tell
it to do that i i told it to run this one
where i did the dash m command yeah so what
i'm going to try i'm gonna try i'm gonna
try logging in again i think i know what
the issue was actually now i think the auth
did work i just didn't select the right
model it wasn't the ui wasn't particularly
obvious so i'm gonna log in this time i'm
gonna do the anthropic one again i'm using
i'm gonna use my max account now that i'm
from now that i know that you can select
different models i'm to be more explicit
in the model I select. So then I'm
going to go here and I'm going to
copy copy that go back here
all right paste that in and then
I'm going to go list anthropic I got
two credentials now just to make it
more that seems like a bad idea I got
this and this okay I don't know
how I'm going to fix that but
anyway open code I got it working so now that we get
that I'm going to stop that And then I'm going to go back and try
the run thing. And this time I'm
going to choose just, I don't know which one
I'm going to choose. Cheap one. I'll
choose this. Yeah. Something cheap
and reliable. All right. So then I'll
go here and I'm going to go back to the
one, but this time I'm going to not use, I'm
going to use dash M. System error
about model name. Okay. I swear that looks like the right name let's try without the well you chose opus 4 can you try opus 4 then maybe I'll just try something well
why would it list the name and not
make the name work yeah I could just do
opus 4 or opus 3 let's see what
happens there Oops, I forgot
the M, dash M, nope, that doesn't work, I don't know, it's
a little beta. Yeah. No, I don't want to
interrupt the phone of trying to connect
to these systems, but I'm trying
to keep thinking out of the box and
I think the biggest bottleneck that we
have is this, relying on these resources to
be able to program so I know that you have
implemented something that I'm still
scratching my head around is the the CUDA and
the Kimi K2 wasn't so i was wondering
if it's possible to run properly somehow
these systems in cpus in a very powerful
way so we can replace this cloud or gemini
yeah to run it locally with those
implications you could use on onyx i think
it's called onyx uh Do you know what I
mean, no? Yeah, I do. You're going
to use these. But because this will be us flying far ahead because this is the
biggest bottleneck we have now, right now.
The timing that we have for resources to
be able to continue. And we're going around
trying to solve this issue and invent new
stuff to connect it, but the bottleneck
is still there. so is it possible that with
this implementation that you have done we
can run this beast in a cpu no no it's too
big it's it's too big it's it's way too big
so uh kimmy k2 is is a trillion parameter
model yeah it's monstrous yeah so what i did
if uh where did i put that uh i think i
put that in yeah they hosted on grok right
they host kimmy on grok no he's talking about
a project i did a couple weeks ago
and what i did on my implementation i didn't
finish it i'm this is a proof of concept uh let's
go here to my recent updates just just type
kimmy i think it's the only one yeah so
kimmy core fan this was the one i did so
what i tried to do here is i what what i wanted
to do is separate all the pieces of the
Kimi K2 mixture of experts and rather
than doing one trillion parameter model I
came up with 365 micro models that I connect
you know independently so that's what I was
attempting to do here so it's you you you
carved out of Kimi all of its micro models
yes that's exactly what i did and then and
then i built and then i packaged each of
those as a kind of cpu friendly version so
it's when you make a request a request
it's actually sort of determining which of the
experts it should do so rather than trying
to you know load a trillion parameter model
it's only loading the particular expert it
needs to say what is machine learning now i
was i was able to get the rudimentary version
of this actually working um it's just i
moved on this is this is called an moe router
right that's that's the the router sits
in front of an mo um yeah moe router sits
in front of the models and figures out which
model it should be routing this particular
request to yes the weights still need to
be loaded and unloaded there's uh there's
it's not exactly a fast start no well the
way each each of the each of the models
is independent so i'm loading i'm loading a
model for for whatever you know it needs to
do so i'm separating it into many many
smaller models and then and then i'm routing it
to david's point yeah that's that's what
actually happens in an mwe architecture is
you have a single front model and you have
a router and it has to do really fast
routing well gateway yeah so but the problem is
the you don't separate all the parts so
what i've done is i separate i separate all
the parts to be independent of one another and
then i do an ultra fast routing using the
the rust based routing system which can
do the routing in milliseconds is there a
is there a benefit to to kind of uh decomposing
uh so to speak um a larger model like that
as opposed to using a smaller model um such
as queen 3 1.7 b um and and just kind of
having those kind of single purpose micro
yeah no you're i'm trying just to push to see
what if i could do it but your approach
probably is more is more logical um what what
you could do is use on and i'm using onyx
as well but onyx um yeah chris this is called
um domain specific narrow narrow scoped
use cases and uh small language models are
the are the future like the problem with very
large models is that they're just big and
you don't ever need 100 100 david i'm what
i'm saying is that that there are these micro
models um that that you could adopt and
and i think that rave's just they're right here
with uh just seeing what's possible yeah
so that's what these models are essentially
doing um so what i what i would likely
do is use that neuro architecture and then
just optimize alongside of one of these lesser
models and then get the performance increase
by having particular neural networks that
are specifically tailored to each part
of the uh domain experts that are being called
so then i'll take a ****** model make it
great greater better all right i gotta jump
i gotta jump to my next call guys um i'm
not sure about open code yet i think maybe i
might clone the repo and see if i can improve
it but uh um i think the takeaway from
this call is basically a lot of the a lot of
the challenge you guys are having seems to
be claude code or sorry clod.md if you
start messing with the clod.md file and start
messing with the hooks there's a lot more
you could probably do i mean many of us are
already connected on linkedin we're trying
to make an effort to like get everyone like
ramped up on this so if you want to message
me either in discord or i guess whatsapp or
linkedin i can try to centralize all this
feedback about where people have like some
sticky spots and maybe we can kind of like
create more of a direct um kind of approach to
this like yeah or our discord which martin
is graciously managing for us um i do think
actually if you have knowledge articles
you're better off putting them into a wiki but um
if someone's interested in that then reach
out otherwise i'm gonna assume that that's
not the approach you want to take there is
yeah it's a great idea and alexander but what
you really want is to be able to point
your claude code flow instance at that knowledge
base that's that's what you want and all
of us can contribute to it and all of us can
leverage it so having it in discord is not
the best like you know can we can we use
this because with the check this out there's
a wiki section here and the you can use cloud
flow to manage the wiki i don't want to
be full of ai slop or anything but we could
go in here and basically point cloud flow and
say organize the wiki for us nice and also
we also have the community.agentix.org
so if anyone wants to contribute in terms of
knowledge like there are features where you
can create a course as well so there there are
mechanics i'll share a brief video on how to
use that if that helps so if anyone is coming
up with learnings we can basically document
that yeah and i'd have a suggestion to
put out like i don't know a blog entry like
it's not not hard you know like you have a
team blog and you just have people posting
like this is what i'm looking at a little video
a little demo and it would create seeds of
conversation that you can take forward and
communicate with roof can you open up that
wiki section for us to contribute to it doesn't
seem to be open i just i i just opened it
just now uh roof don't don't forget if you're
going to share your implementation of the
web hook to be able to the one that you
show in the beginning oh uh that is the web hooks
are already integrated with cloud flow and
if you were if you're curious about my web
sockets that's in a that's in a agentic flow branch and I publish it I still can't edit the wiki yeah the wiki's there
but we can't edit it oh do I need a new
page or something yeah okay one other
branch okay yeah I think it's
called agentic flow Lewis I might have
to I might have to like I might have
to give like access in my settings
or something yeah Yeah. Thanks, Reuven.
You better jump to your call, mate. Yeah, I'm late. I'm late. All right. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Reuven. See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
