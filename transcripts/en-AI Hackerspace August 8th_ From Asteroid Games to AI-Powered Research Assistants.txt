Hello, all. Okay. Ghost tools. Reuven is on vacation
this week, as you guys know. So we have â€“
so Jed's going to be technical lead, and
then same thing. I'll facilitate the guest
speakers and the various lightning talks and
all that kind of stuff. This is the pre
-show, so feel free to unmute
yourself if you want to chat with
anybody else. We've got
everything else. Better infamous than
famous, you know? Yeah, that's right.
I'll take infamy. me we are live in this
week uh reuben is on uh reuben's on vacation
he's enjoying lobster and and uh fish
fries no doubt on the east coast and uh jed
has taken the helm uh the technical
leave for us today and then we'll dive
into all the various presentations and demos
hey jed how's it going hello everyone and
welcome to this friday's hacker space so for
those of you who unfamiliar a lot of us
use llms to write code and see if i can get
this working today i did not make the
requisite sacrifices the demo gods
so we will find out how well this
does or doesn't while we're
waiting i'm going to see if we
can kick off any instance of cloud
code to generate a browser-based game
and so as we're going through everyone
else's demo we'll let that **** along
in the background and then come to
it at a later time. Oh, neat. I think that's
set up. Does anyone have a preference? As for the style of
game, you mean, Jed? Well, I mean, Asteroid is a classic.
Tetris as well. I'm an Asteroids
guy, yeah. Okay, so create Asteroid.
How many quarters? Okay, so create a an offline browser based asteroid game which relies
on yeah, androids be it another time you
can actually simulate the war games you
know, from the classic movie would you like
to, or shall we play a game right, it's
more of a I actually redid it with Lovable
about a month or so ago just to play around
with it, but I like what you're doing,
this is pretty cool I'm excited to see what
this will turn out. Use test-driven
development. Create playwright to
renders correctly. What else should I
be using here? Just a note, at the beginning,
you have an Android game because it's
right at the outset. Anteroid. Okay,
let's see if it can figure out what
Android actually means. or what variation it
comes up with yeah we could always use
a little more entropy curious what other game you've
already made too jed because you've tested
this before showing it i'm sure oh you you
think too highly of me you know what i
want to do as a game so you know in twitter
spaces i feel like there's a lot of like
bugs and language people use one i could say
i see that lately is like um um like people
say all the time so i would love to do
in like a twitter space count the amount of
times everybody says it and then have like
a contest at the end like a fun little
because the agents could like on the background
make like little like like kind of games
like that you know tally like interactive
games it'd be really fun so what did you
have in there you had uh okay almost go i
see initialize clause flow we depend on it
for the system prompt well that's so many
of those old arcade cabinets have such
elaborate artwork um i i mistakenly
thought like berserk i thought
it was berserko and you know i'm sure
there's several other games but it's got
the name wrong. That'd be funny. AI is pretty good
about tracking typos, but sometimes,
sometimes not. I love misspelling
with it. Anteroid. You guys ever
prompt images just out of random
numbers, see what it generates? Just
like 10 eyes, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, see
what it just... It's kind of weird.
I wonder what it thinks when it
tries to do that. You should try
that. so i've been doing that for fun
i download them and then i just
keep a couple like i do do a lot of images
but i it will be a screenshot of something
i'm doing even a terminal session or
something figure out the prompt like jet post
something i won't even give an instruction i
want to see what will go it normally gets it
you know i see this a prompt for cloud code
or something you know i love that as a
process you take the screenshot you give it
the error log and then you give it feedback and
then like all three combined is like really
strong yeah about that um it's taking its
own screenshot and because it's a docker
image it's already able to tail the log out of
the docker container that's being created
and in theory it's has access to root within
this environment so it can start and stop the
docker image rebuild it and then try again
so this is taking off we have five agents
running concurrently and perhaps we can
bring up our first guest wonderful excellent
jets i love this i love this to get something
started and then revisit it later on
in that in the in the episode that's really
neat so um we got a few folks today excuse me
sebastian who came to us uh who we we uh
found and connected at the toronto tech week
and meetup events uh it's got some uh a neat
mcp tool to show us And then we have
Sergio as well. And Sergio has been
a long-time member, so I'm looking
forward to seeing what he's got. Probably
have some membership updates and stuff
later on from Brad. So why don't we
launch off? Now, Lightning Talks,
usually we go about four minutes. We
try to keep them crisp, but then
there's lots of time for question and
answer afterwards. We've got a fair
amount of time today, too. So if there's some
folks that have some things they'd like
to share and or demo, please feel free to
message Jet or I or put your hand up, let
us know, and we'll try to orchestrate it
all and weave it in. So, Sebastian,
how are you, sir? I'm well, ready
to have some fun. Let's get started
there. I'm going to screen share with
you quickly here. I hope I don't have
any random message notification pop ups,
but, you know, if you if it happens, please don't
mind. yeah i've got this uh okay go ahead
you should be good thank you very much
so essentially i built like a fun web app
thinking of like some of the latest things we've
been like doing lately so i thought about
making like a really like super intelligent
scraping system so building essentially a
bunch of mcps scraping autonomously across
different specializations and then also
applying learning like intelligence to them so
they get better at it and they could also
qualify like research or essentially have a
very constructive autonomous like cloud
deployment so that they can 24 7 go on and and get
papers also i added to it i want to make
them accumulate all the knowledge and ground
to it and then generate its own like research
papers its own discovery its own kind
of combinations of things right now what
you're seeing and also like a root agent's
favorite concepts with like a little bit of a
temporal filter seeing what it's great being
like recently maybe you see like the most
recent like repositories was popular i think
you just look that up in github right now
you're seeing a lot of like it's not like
it's it's not fully deployed so i've been
going through the process of essentially going
on my cloud services so the initial prompts
were about orchestrating the the visual system
a rough copy right then after enhancing
the backend system and then uh i was i
deployed the mcps locally so it started generating
data but i wanted to do it autonomously
and then being that so so right now i'm
configuring the front end with the deployed
backend uh system and then here you could
see on my fire store uh i got um there's this
thing i got like all the data kind of like
collecting into firebase right so it's going
to be interesting to see once deployed i'll
update maybe next week uh over the over the
weeks and months how much it collects and
generates and we could all maybe chat with it
uh and just like play around you know maybe
you have like uh as a group an interactive
mode so just thinking about some of those
things it'll be cool to see in the future but
yeah thank you guys appreciate sharing wow
yeah my goodness because think about the idea
of perplexity and all these guys they're just
like a small startup but they're probably
doing these kinds of things right they're
deploying probably their whole web but it'd be
interesting doing a specialized a more
focused approach to maybe see what we can come
up with it's more like for fun creative right
now but let's it could really maybe come up
with some really cool stuff i mean i can
easily see applications like um you know i
work with bid teams and that's a high pressure
high stress environment where tools, the more
tools you can do for automating, paper
pushing, data pushing. So my mantra is just
personal task automation. The human being is
going to be the creative engine, but the way
we can enable them to get the outcome, this
is just a direct, it's got that business value.
It's awesome, man. Totally, totally awesome. You know what's an interesting
point you say? You know how we have,
you don't have to pay for all these apis or
databases sometimes it's interesting
seeing what we have for free but then you
know you get a lot of abstract papers what
if the agent starts to accumulate and combine
the concepts of that researcher to then
try to generate it and maybe in different
variations because only human is just one human
or a small team but imagine it might
actually be able to even research papers or
compare it to the it'll be interesting just Going
back to that, you're writing an RFP, which
is quite complex. Maybe you're
replacing, say, a contact center and
a frontline system. Welfare, say welfare,
you're dealing with homeless people,
people without money for food. And
that's a complex. But you need to do
a lot of research. Canada has a good
welfare system. Norway has one. Switzerland.
You want to mine the best and say,
for my country, I want to replace the
systems I have. That's a great point.
That's the kind of, because I sit in
that space. You know, I deal with a lot
of that kind of environment, contact
center and omnichannel. It'd be nice to make
a lot of research. And you have teams
spending months, 18 months doing
that research. And, you know, in
North America, very few people go maybe to look
at Japanese universities or they look at, you
know, in Africa and all these places.
Imagine translating it as well. And also, you
said that about the distributing it, right?
Yeah, that's right. It's just getting like
a global connected parallel like kind of
system. i i noticed a pop up there sebastian
that said no mock data oh sorry sorry yeah i
know right now because it's connected to it's
not built like the the cloud deploy system
like i have it um i need to connect it
properly to the uh so that it's autonomously
working with the mcps and playwright right
yeah so then it is i was trying to finish
it yesterday but not enough time like also
doing all these other stuff so i'm gonna do
something i think this is good if we do our
side projects like this for fun maybe 15 or
30 minutes a day they will accumulate you know
because i don't want to overwhelm myself
and just being now i'm going to put everything
away and focus on it there's so much to
do but um i i think it will come along over
the weeks i think we could all do that and
just like kind of that's why they just build
on top of each other if i can uh talk
sebastian to mondrip's question uh just to let
him know so i contacted sebastian and we are
he's trying to give me a little instruction
set on i should do a i should do one
hopefully we're already working on getting the
setup if you like and the prompts it'd be
good to do a quick loom just showing hey
install a quick mcp on playwright and maybe
with jewels just like a quick loom you know like
it'd be probably very instructional because
we all have to go through that process or
like people just it'd be helpful to know how
to scrape something you know these companies
are doing it why can't we right so yeah
suggestion are you planning to kind of share
open source this or i want to share that
you know i feel like right now it's a
community we have a lot of really cool stuff i love
sharing with everybody so that we can all
build on top of it uh and look under the
hood what you're doing because i can think of
like we can all contribute to it open source
that's right because there's perspective and
safety and all these companies they're
they're making they're charging but why can't
we have an open one just for the community
you mentioned about translation right so our
colleague ben's um ben's basically has a database
um i'll show you the link um he has a
database in hungarian on psychology imagine
wow i heard my name mentioned thanks your
translation thing that you've done and that
is magnificent maybe he should mention that
that's that's such a like imagine oh we have
the opportunity to combine everybody's like
expertise around the world and like you can
just translate everything now just in like a
button it's crazy to have the ai google's
models are great for that i mean even samsung
on their phone over the last two three years
it's been really good you've seen the voice
the streaming and all that it's pretty
incredible i would love to for this it was
just kind of like a sci -fi thinking i guess but
imagine we all open a workspace right now
and we all connected our own dev tools
isolated and we all just contributed to a project
like talking to it we could just talk to it
maybe on a walk or you know typing why not
contributed to a unified commit or like a
repository that'd be kind of cool i don't know
like it's if we all had extra time to do for
fun right we all have work and stuff but
stuff like that i think will be very valuable
maybe in universities or for people just like
a high school class it'd be kind of fun
what they come up with oh i absolutely agree
so the kids together Sorry, go ahead, Jed. Thank you for
sharing, Sebastian. I don't know if we
want to move along to the next... Yeah,
I'm sorry. Every time we rant, I'm sorry.
No, it's great. It's great. Just one
more quick question. You're very
passionate. It's good. We love it. Thank
you so much. I love that about going
to Toronto. Everyone who's around should
come. If I could ever go on the other
places, I'll always stop by. But it's
nice to see people and talk about it just
for the passion of it. And it could really
help others, you know. this tuesday this
coming tuesday on the 12th is the next
one so everybody i'm coming down and
there's some folks yeah um antoineta and a
few other i guess antoineta is flying
in she's going to be uh in the city so
from the uh west coast that's really neat
and that's awesome um on some medical
sorry what's that antoineta looking
forward to meeting everybody there yeah
that's gonna be great we'll all come down
early for the day and we can grab some
lunch before the event that'll be uh
it'll be wonderful perfect super thank
you sebastian amazing when we can uh
there's a way to play with it really looking
forward to it 100 it'd be nice to push
through give me a few weeks maybe a
week or two let's see but i'd love to thank
you so much Yep. All right. So, Sergio, do we have, let me see. Sergio Pasquale. Are you with us? No, Sergio. Sergio
didn't make it in. All right. Sergio Villanueva
is in the house, but I'm not
ready to present. Oh, no. it's okay like things
are so quick we you know it's like i'd
love to hear the ideas yeah so uh sergio do
you want to come back and do a little demo
later on in the hour or is it next week
no i'm i'm a i'm a different sergio i'm
just um oh i see yeah but um yeah i'm happy
i'm happy to i'm happy to improvise something
but um but um i have some cool projects
but i'm not a i'm not part of the
schedule i'm a different surgeon sorry very
good very good um okay well i don't know uh
brad do i do uh uh should i put you on the spot
see what thoughts you have around the
website and how things are generally going
with uh the volunteers and the members
that are working on that stuff oh nothing
like being put on the spot can you hear me
okay here okay good um yeah so website
we're up and running um everything works we're
looking for content so anyone that has
content that wants to come ahead go on sign up on
the website community .agenix.org if you're
an existing subscriber we're going to bring
you over Nick and I are going handhold and
make sure everything's all set up you're
going to be on a legacy system so you don't
have to worry about anything so we're going
to take care of our existing subscribers
right now we're just really wanting to put
content on so So any kind of courses, love
Sebastian's Loom idea. You want to be a
contributor, a good way to actually
talk about and promote yourself as
a contributor to the Agentex website.
So it's awesome. So we'll be doing a big
push. We're going to migrate all the existing
members right now, about 2,000. Plus, I
believe we have about 500 to 600 that have
come through Looma and all the other sources
that we're going to be migrating. so that's
kind of our short-term goal iteration process
makes make a whole bunch of mistakes start
getting a whole bunch of content provide a
lot of extra value over the summer and then
the big push is going to be coming in september
so if you know any friends and family
get them started right now we're going to be
doing a massive push in september so we're
desperately looking for uh not desperately but
it'd be really helpful if we had some sponsors
uh to to actually help us do this uh if
you're a course creator it's a really good way
to promote yourself create some courses
provide some value to the community um it's
we're using something called disco which has
a really easy ai you can upload a pdf or
just verbally chat to it and click a button and
it creates the courses similar to what a
university or college or an edx would do so that
content's all there that's it for the
website one last thing is we have a big push
and thank you we have a massive community
thank you to everyone helping with the
website matt nick the other sergio martin a
whole bunch of people are helping out but
we're also working on a big push called
accreditation so this is going to be something
unique in the industry and we're looking
to be really the first so we're just
brainstorming right now we got a big community
but the the outcome where it's going
right now um if it is recorded um don't bring
this up later on uh because things may
change but what we're looking at right now
is we're we're going to be starting with the
top of the top tier agentics engineer
certification so something that we go through
verify that you um adhere to ethics and
safety and way things go making sure that you
have a at least a solid knowledge not not
just a basic knowledge but a solid knowledge
of general computing and computers so you
don't have to go to formal school but
typically you would have to be in the industry
for a number of years so this kind of degree
is not really made for a vibe coder at
the start you'll learn your way to get there
making sure that you contribute significantly
at least in one open source project and
then we're looking at more of like a doctoral
type program where you present in front
of essentially a board to to back up your
dissertation or a project that is
fundamental in the hndx community so those
are kind of the guidelines for the big
degree it's going to be very difficult
to do very exclusive to help people
get there we're spending a lot
of time on having courses and
essentially similar to a graduate school micro
certification program so you go and if you're
just starting out your vibe coder here's
a series of courses past the courses we're
looking for course instructors to provide
these you'll have a level one then a medium
and an advanced and finally after the advanced
hopefully with some coaching and some hard
work you'll be ready for the accreditation
so a lot going on in the education a lot
going on in the website stuff even though it's
summertime and some of us are on vacation
um we're still moving forward and i want to
give a big shout out to everyone that's been
really helpful um and if i missed your name
i apologize i'm i'm on the spot here so brad
can i ask some questions about um this um you
know first of course the course material
um content etc so i'd i've got a community
about 1500 across new zealand australia and
minnesota and inner circle build a circle etc
so i do a lot of automated automated
course generation and you were talking about a
place to advertise i guess or to to get more
attention um you know i i'm just leaving you
to think about some of that um in terms of
accreditation uh that's fantastic but there's
a i guess agentics is a more technical more
uh more knowledgeable communities how i see
it there's a lot of people who i'm a carpenter
i want to be an ai engineer we you know
that is something that i would expect not not
that sort of content is what you're looking
at um and also that particular website
hnx.org i thought it was i just uh if you
could post the link for me to explore a little
bit i've looked at disco since i've become
aware of it so it's it seems to be pretty
cool um happy to help in any way um you know
in terms of showcasing or even collaborating
and adding content. I think Jed's
created a lot of good material. Mondweep has
been doing outreach. He's come to us and
presented to our community. So we
absolutely are heavily engaged and we love
AgentX and sort of the bleeding frontier
that it's pursuing. I'm probably in a place
to distill it because what I do is I take
every technique and try to build a production
-ready system and see if I know enough,
I have enough skill to utilize that technique
that I'm finding out of AgentX. mostly via
Chris Barlow who are from our side they
attend it regularly and New Zealand the New
Zealand crew right Mark Vincent so Ravi I just
want to I want to get to some of the other
questions as well yeah sorry go ahead no no
that's okay um Lorraine you had you had your
hand up there I do I've just put in my um
project management hat on so doing this
certification process might take a while i was
thinking let's consider things like cpd right
because um that's an easy way in and
when you go to access companies and you say
okay we can give you some cpd points i think
that will be useful um i also think that we
should be thinking about you know tldrs so
maybe like bite-sized courses so there needs
to be some sort of what i would call like a
personality or an angle which means why would
people come and use our platform to learn
and do something so we have like different
levels so accessible to the novice accessible
to the expert because you have different
you know different needs and I also think
when framing if we want to be really really
robust so to get like a US visa there are
certain competencies it asks for right if you
want to get the the highest level so maybe
we can start thinking about those things
because it's well if you do this possibly you
could be eligible because we ask you maybe
you've spoken at one event or done something
else if we're benchmarking against well-known
criteria so it then doesn't feel like it's
made up it feels like it's with a purpose
so if I was putting my instructional design
hats on those are the things I think we
should be thinking about there's an entire
community Lorraine that are going back and
forth over how to do the certification I think
Brad we can we can pass along the invitation
link yep so I think that's great and just
very briefly we're yeah I would love to have
you if you could help us out Lorraine and anyone
else, we are really looking at catering
to all different types of agentic engineers
from people that just started. So quick how
-to guides, getting your repo set up, getting
code spaces set up. What is an MCP? What is
an MCP? Security. And these would be perfect
for anyone that's good at Loom. So quick
two or three minute with a couple of screen
grabs and going through those so that We call
it the zero-to-one type of market, and then
going right up to the advanced, which is
taking some clips from what Jed and what
Reuven and others are presenting, what Bron did
a couple weeks ago, and just maybe showing
here's what state-of-the -art is, and then maybe
taking a little bit more time to show this
is how you do state -of-the-art. So we're
looking for all kinds of different content to
cater to different needs. um the big thing
is we're taking our computer background which
is we iterate so let's let's try something
get it going the accreditation as Lorraine
mentioned we we have to take some time uh to
do that so really love you to join the
community I think there's a couple of hundred of
us that are there and we're pretty pretty
active brainstorming ideas and um I think
we're moving moving along sorry and one one other
thing um so i think in terms of like business
model right is that where we have this we
teach you all these things then it's like
well we're the experts where you know if you
still get stuck we are here and we can
support you on it so rather than be you know a
course a bit like what we're doing with the
website so it's like okay we can teach you
all this stuff even when you teach people
they're still not ready to go but yes we can
still as a community we can actually come
and help you in your organization to actually
execute this as well so i think if we if we
think of it like a almost like we'll call it
like a lead flow or pipeline type of thing
so i think we should be um we should think how
we we craft this all nice so um uh i just
want to get to the next demos as well
thank you everybody that's uh looking
forward to the uh to the updates and hearing
more about how that all evolves and brad
you'd be able to share the links for uh and
when the next meetings are that kind of
thing with the yeah i'll i'll get the
link and post it image i'll post it in the
chat thank you amazing thank you uh so we
have nolan nolan's got something that he
can demo for us today hey nolan how are
you? Hey, great, Rob. Nice to see you. How's
it going, everyone? Okay, so share
is disabled. Okay, yep. One second. We're being, I'm
looking for... Nolan, I'm glad to see
you're not driving. Okay, are you ready
to share, Nolan? Yeah, I'm good.
Okay, go for it. Okay, let's see. You see it? Showrunner? Yeah. Okay, cool. So I've been, I
mentioned this sort of yesterday on the
call, just alluded to some work that
I was doing where I was thinking
about, you know, just the capabilities
of Claude-flow and extending it into sort
of other domains. I think there's a lot
of sort of powerful features that Claude-flow
exposes from like a workflow perspective
that um you know it it opens up the ability
for clod code and clod flow to be used for
um sort of non-coding purposes but you know
essentially there's there's some coding
actually happening but i uh i recently got
involved in this this discord uh channel for
this this cartoon series called uh or this
company called showrunner and showrunner i think
just got some um an investment from uh
amazon so they've got like an ai platform
which is primarily um used inside of uh discord
um actually let me just share my change
my share here how do i my screen. I'm just doing
my browser. But essentially, inside
of Discord, they have sort of commands
and slash commands that allow you to
tap into the various capabilities for character
generation, scene generation, and NLP
to sequence this stuff together. So, um, I
use this opportunity, uh, now I need to change
my sharing. One sec. Where'd I go here? Sorry. Share. I use this opportunity to try my hand at, uh, can you see my
club or my, uh, cursor here? Yep. So I use this opportunity
to work with Claude Flow and develop an
MCP server that helps with script that automates
script generation based on sort of the
characteristics of Exit Valley. So Exit
Valley is one of the shows where they're having
sort of community contributors to create
these shows, and they're going to vet those and
judge those. And if one of your episodes
is selected, you potentially can make some
royalties if the show goes to air or however
it's being monetized. So I developed this
MCP server. So if I just open up a
new terminal here, Google Cloud, got my showrunner Discord. Ideally, I want to
try and tie this into Discord with
a bot to be able to use the channels and
the slash commands to generate the
content. But I have to talk to their
admins about that. So I've got a
prompt here. uh use cloud flow swarm
to generate an exit valley episode using
the showrunner mcp based on this script i just
pasted in sort of like a synopsis perform
deep research on relevant news topics and
people to improve the narrative if applicable
uh give it some guidance someone needs to
die uh it's you know it's very satirical and
kind of like gruesome uh lots of swearing and
stuff like that which is kind of fun for a
cartoon uh also add a new variation of the
The Crypt Keeper location scenes also generate
a comprehensive report in Markdown
format using the generate episode tool. So I'm
going to let that run, and that's going to
**** away. That'll show you sort of the next
thing that happens. So it generates an enhanced
script in Markdown. And then what I've
done is I just take that and I
create a little Claude flow
project or Claude project here. I dump
that markdown in and I gave it some styling
here, but I'll just show a couple examples.
I'll put these into the chat. They're
actually quite funny. Where's my, i shared one of these
is it runway three in the background or
what's the what's the what are they using uh
from a model perspective um i don't know
can you guys see discord here yep so like
here's an example oh my god mark is that
a ******* ak-47 just sitting there uh yeah
that's um suboptimal who the **** leaves
that lying around suboptimal it's a *******
murder machine mark okay okay let's just
iterate on this no need to escalate iterate
you're about to get iterated into oblivion
you algorithmic **** wait kim let's
optimize this optimize this you caesar wannabe
piece of **** sorry for the uh i guess that
one had some swears and apologies for
anyone who's sensitive to that but it's uh
it's pretty funny so like you know inside
the channels here. You've got different
commands, characters. You can generate
characters. You can generate sets. Incredible. So it's pretty
cool. It's kind of weird that it's all
inside of Discord. Like, I get kind
of why they're doing it, but they
don't have an API. So my next steps is I
actually reached out to support and said,
you know, I'm an agentic engineer. I'm
also creative and i'm i'm interested in i'm
building this agentic essentially script
system because i can go out in real
like the the way that the prompting is
working it's just going out and doing deep
research could be could be stuff on uh uh you
know current topics you could schedule an
agent to go and like get you know real
-time newsworthy newsworthy facts and
and automate this thing so um there's a lot a
lot to be done and i want to see if i can
get access to there um you remember those
political cartoons i think it'd be funny
seeing little like just little jokes like
people would love these just to see yeah totally
uh here's another one uh this was sort of
an earlier version of one um but i gave it
some guidance to sort of model it off of
swarms and pointed to that uh um pointed
to that uh quad flow documentation i haven't
read this in a while but um it might be actually
no you know what that's not a good this
one had some errors in it um here's another
one you know it's interesting we come to
the concept again so when you're generating
there's always i love the no filter stuff but
then like at some point you might have to do
filtering right so then the the system of
the prompting itself has to it's interesting
how it all comes back together oh yeah
well uh i think that they're probably using
something in the back like a model in the
background that um have some right but you can
kind of go around some but if you get special
access you get like like permission to like
play with it without it but then when you
release it you know like my script generation
isn't putting any profanity and whatnot
in because it's using Anthropic under the
Clot under the hood so it's you know it's
maybe the clean version. It's the person, the
person itself right? Yeah you know
with I could I could augment
that with other approaches but
yeah that's Discord channel it's called
Showrunner oh yeah we should all
share that to see hey yeah that's that i
just recently created a repo with 600 plus
sub agents for all kinds of things non-coding
i just shared a link in the chat you might
be interested in reading over thank you thanks
so current currently this is sorry go ahead
currently it's it's you know i've I took
the MCP approach, but my next step, thank
you for sharing that, Chris, because my next
step was basically, you know, I think just the
architecture of Claude code in combination
with Claude is toast. It's ******* toast.
Okay. Adam, Adam, the big, beautiful. There we go. That was a quick
reaction. Good job. Yeah. My next step
is to actually try and build this more
into the, the cloud flow dot cloud
folder architecture. Cause I think I
was listening to a podcast the other day.
I think, you know, there's a lot of
opportunity for non -technical people to
use cloud flow for purposes beyond coding.
It's just, it's, it's an incredible
orchestration framework. That's right. That's
right. john petty was really speaking to
that a few weeks ago and i think there's
some that's uh it is a big uh field as far as
multi-tool orchestration and how that all
plays out you should make a fun app
like you could have it like generate you can
have a comedian go on stage using it to
first get or just put a button where you
activate it and talk to it to generate
your your your theme and then it just generates
it'll be interactive like look how you
made us all laugh yeah very good we
have uh we have one more
presentation uh from bensa but before
we get there jed how's it going on
our androids game progress update
it's running is the short answer so um
now we've got androids i don't know if
it's streaming well but it works keeps
track of the store it drives around
we can change the we can change
the sprites i'm sure and this
all i think your volume is a little
low there jed is it yeah a little
quiet is this any better yes yeah cool so
anteroids is now working um it was one prompt
i shared the prompt earlier in the comments
and in from that one prompt and And then
the emphasis on making it darker and making
sure Playwright is able to visually confirm
that it's working was able to get the
game working for me. And now I'm able to
revisit, what is this, 1980s, 1970s arcading? Yeah, it's 1970s.
You need to be flying straight up and
reappearing at the bottom and going
as fast as you can. Okay. So the
good news is that everything else
works. You can drive around. You
can shoot stuff. so what used to
take developers maybe weeks to
do this in 1970s hardware took
me 20 minutes um and 15 of those
minutes was waiting i wonder that uh
intro to programming class where they make
you make a game what happens now for the
kids like they just well it's how to
write words that's what they have to
do write words The interesting part
is that hackathons now are very easy to
win, provided there are no other
agentists also there. Looking forward
to showing up at the next New
York hackathon. There it is. There
it is. That's good. Very quickly, a thought. What do you guys think
about how children should be taught
programming now? I don't know. the
short answer is they should probably understand
what a tech stack is and the components
of a tech stack what goes in the front
end what goes in the mid end what goes in
the data layer what goes in the application
layer but the actual syntax probably is
irrelevant i don't write assembly there are
probably three people in this call who
know a little bit but definitely couldn't
write a full application in assembly and it's
becoming increasingly irrelevant so it's
about architecture it seems that way i
mean i didn't even give any specific uh design
direction to anteroids i even misspelled
asteroids and it's still i love the misspelling
you could type so fast misspelling it's
so good so it was now to be fair the use
case was simple but i'm of the opinion children
should for those who wish to enter this
space should focus as much as possible on
building that muscle learning what prompts
or what descriptions what text is most
important to achieving the outcome they need because
the reality is very few people here myself
included can teach it it is definitely
something they can learn but i don't yet think
it is something that is readily taught i
love that like young people the kids like
they like question so much so i've seen like
this toy dinosaur like company where they
just have like a voice you know live streaming
with it and just imagine how annoying
like i would love to ask 50 questions right but
your parents at like 7 a.m they'll get angry
so if you just ask it everything and you
just learn and learn and learn like it's
just crazy that they have that now you know
like you don't have any children sebastian
do you no not yet not yet okay very good
awesome i think maybe that's why i have some
time you know but yeah all in time no rush
um bence how you doing i'm muted yes yeah
yeah yeah i'm here yes sorry i'm outside
so i'm off cam for the for the
for the minute okay sharing is not turned
on yet okay you ready okay it's
turned on yeah okay showing my screen
just quickly here um here's
the entire one can you guys see it now yep yep showrunner
showrunner alpha yes okay so this is the the main
concept that one we intro kind of is a
mental health application so it's a reg based
on just 99 hunger Hungarian documents
collected through 30 years, like articles about
how to approach cancer patients
in hospitals, you know, and relatives
as well, you know, how to process the
mental burden, what you've got as a cancer
patient or relative of a patient. And that's
working in English. So the language
model perfectly translates everything
which is available only in Hungarian
to English. But the interesting
one is the Indian. I can't remember now which language is this. It's Bangla. Yeah. Could you go to
the homepage? is the home page here. What I love is
Sarvan AI, right? What I love is,
I think, Bensi, you discover
Sarvan AI, right? Sarvan is a brilliant
language model. Servant AI? No, Sarvan. Yeah, it's a sovereign
language model. This is it. Sarvan. Okay,
okay. Excellent. And they've got orange
orange color as well which is just coincidence
and interestingly i shared this with
some of this so so i said if it depends for
example if you type there talk to me in
assamese or something like that so assamese
is a language is my native language so i
shared with some like perioperative surgeons
in in assam and i said guys what do you think
about them and they gave some very interesting
feedback because many decision making
happens very socially in india so the the
cultural aspects like lots of people want to
know and and healthcare professionals are
overwhelmed by that and therefore they were
like they were they were like really
interested in things like this which is basically
just quite accurate like what they they
ask some questions themselves and the
interesting part of it is that the whole
database is in hungarian and it was very
relevant in terms of how the information was
given in a local language yeah this is in
hindi yeah gosh any language so you can see
on the exactly on the right side that this
is a hungarian original document all the
chunks and this is in hindi summarized so
it's a retrieval from have you played around
with doing photos i noticed like it doesn't
extract photos text but like too good
but there's probably some cool models like
that's amazing yeah i've got another project
for brand visual designers a book is
processed and you don't only get a text response
you get logos and color palettes as a
response from the api it's tricky mixing them
right like text and visual what does that
dance it's go hair um multi-model it's a
canadian oh yeah yeah so so they are brilliant
on um yeah oh you know with text and
images together version 4 and then version
4 embed and then you can chunk
it up and um use super base or
any four spreads sorry um and
how are you the feedback how are
people finding the accuracy of
the translations we haven't tested the
indian translation accuracy yet the english
is fine and uh the hungarian accuracy is
97 percent i i have followed so i looked
through asimist translation it's perfect actually
perfect really okay it's very very good
actually so um yeah i mean if there are anyone
from india here i think maybe worth um getting
some feedback on this um yeah yeah how
many dialects are there in india sorry how
many how many dialects or written languages
are there in in india so this supposed 22
languages i mean if you think about number of
languages there are like hundreds there's
about 1500 under the constitution of india that
are recognized or known so ben sir on that
note just wanted to uh talk about there's tribes
like tribal language like south hall and
all that and their language is not electronic
so there's currently india's building
the models for those languages by interviewing
capturing that and the nuances of the
language the way they use it it varies a lot
so they're trying to capture all that would be
good to be able to find a way to integrate
that because that's where the lack of
accessibility is you know about this social decision
making around medical mental health or
medical nature uh so it would be a huge uh huge
asset to i think that kind of geography and
africa as well the same thing is happening
in africa yeah big opportunity for for
these guys um they are working on with the
indian government i guess yep all right thanks guys that's really
uplifting to see the technology being
put to those kinds of those kinds
of projects and tools where that
can go my goodness so we're if there's anyone else
that would like to show or demo we've got
a little bit of time yeah I can go go ahead how you doing can you hear me all
right oh yeah can you hear me all right yeah
there we are oh John O 'Hare yeah that's right
hi John hi how you doing so I've literally
been throwing this code up the stairs as people
have been talking uh so it's in a sorry
state but I think I think you know that's
the vibe isn't it so I'm just going to go with
it uh because you only live once uh and see
where I end up so the whole of screen two
that's fine have you is that oh wait is that
now sharing so this is not how it's supposed
to be clear uh i'm i'm live debushing sorry
sorry my apologies john you got to share again
oh okay two seconds that's not your bad
that's my bad how is is that working
yeah yes perfect good okay oh neat okay
cool right so what i'm going to do
very very quickly so this i started this
a year ago this is, is there many coming
across LogSeek? It's like Obsidian,
it's open source. It's just knowledge
management. So the thing with knowledge
management is the Spring Force stuff is next to
useless because it's very confusing. This
is my baby graph. This is the public graph
that's published online. You know, I'm into too
many things and it's just this information
fire hose, which got much worse with the
advent of AI. So I started pivoting to
trying to manage my knowledge with this. And
then I got very heavily distracted 12 months
ago with this. So my background is in human
-scale telepresence, so large-scale
visualization systems, holodecks-type stuff,
which is the things that you see there, in
which there was a bit of kind of data
manipulation in 3D spaces. So it's mixed reality,
telecollaboration, working with other
people, working with now AI agents, I mean, so
distributed systems, kind of protocol-level
stuff. uh it's just very it's a wild moment
right so i i started trying to put together
a a way to deal with the um the incoming
firehose of stuff just for my own information
management purposes so this i mean 12 months
ago just vibe coding whatever you want to
call it at the time managed to stand up
listening javascript straight away this just takes
the ***** the data off github re-springifies
it turns it into something that's crockable
in a 3d space and it just worked straight
away in ar and i was like well that's very
gratifying and i thought well why don't i do
it multi-user in rust that was a mistake because
i'm not a programmer and i didn't realize
how difficult that was going to be so i i'm
now a hundred thousand mines of code 12
months later kind of become a labor of love
in a way uh and it's all you know because because
code code it's all very well documented
and stuff the the system now is uh spring
solving on a gpu uh for multi-user so it's
got a single source of truth so you can connect
multiple clients to it it pulls the information
from github which is sourced in the log
seek stuff that you saw which is the
knowledge management stuff and then it re-indexes
it through rag and microsoft graph rag and
uh other things it has a voice-to-voice layer
it has a obviously it's got the agency
layer and this is what really what the crux of
the of the demo here is you know there's all
kinds of interfaces and off and that's all
well and good but the thing that i've suddenly
started to add in which has made everything
false multiplayer 10 times as good is the
is the the thing that just suddenly makes it
you know the the can do anything jarvis
knockoff so i mean i'm just going to type the word
test in here because we don't have time for
that but so you can you can spawn up a hive
mind uh on the data that you have access
to here and then it brings in all of the
uh the monitoring stuff which is based on agentic
flow uh and i'm not really sure how any
of that works because this is how it goes
with this stuff you know um i was trying to
use a much cleaner mcp interface over the over
the existing port because everything obviously
is dockerized and speaking to everybody
else's points about getting these things to
do anything i've been getting it to do things
that are right outside the domain of um of
coding so like a full air circuit board for a
uh preamp like a preamp with a bit of character
which somebody told me to make so it
created the circuit board in my docker i have
all the latex tools all the rust tools all
the usual tools that you'd have all the
electronics tools uh all of the um just whatever
you can think of that you can digitize slap
it in the docker connect it to the visualization
system voice voice go and make a thing
deliver the thing when it's done and there's
a this is kind of the opportunity that i'm
seeing when i'm talking to other people here
is that they want to see something that's
a bit Like Andy, they really don't want to
look at a CLI interface. And showing people
that it spits out a circuit board with four
layers of checked code and a bill of materials,
and it's $120 for this preamp, it's just
wild. It's unscrewing people's heads. It's
passing the circuit analysis checklists.
It's giving you a bill of materials. It's
a four-layer board. My first degree was
electronics, and since I've been doing
these things, So I've been kind of
ranging around all of these different
specialisms for years. And suddenly all of
them can just be stuck in a Docker container
and you can stick a knockoff Java's
interface on it. And, you know, how much are you
actually getting out of the performance
optimizer telling you how much CPU it's using
at a given moment? Not a great deal,
but people do feel strangely comforted by
this stuff. And so that's good. So this is
working through my space mouse, which is why
it's kind of woozing around a little bit.
but all of these things are parts of my
information corpus and they'd normally be
spread out in a much more attractive way but
all of this works in AR and all of this
works multi-user and all of it has infinitely
tunable everything. But the main thing
is that it voice-to -voice connects to
ruv-swarm on the back end now and can just
do anything, connect to a robot, print
out a circuit board, do whatever. It's
wild. So exciting. And you say you're
not a programmer. No, not at all. I've
never really touched code. It's 100,000 lines
of Rust, Cuda, PTX, TypeScript, Docker,
Docker, Docker, Docker. I've got 12 Dockers
here now because there's the, you know, there's
the Whisper. It's all local as well. All
this will run local. So there's Whisper.
There's the local infancy. There's the local
text-to-speech, speech -to-text, the RAG
stuff, the Swarm stuff, the interface stuff, Docker, Docker, Docker,
Docker, all the way down. And just keeping
that secure, it's very hard to get Claude's
flow to talk across Docker boundaries
into other code bases. It gets very confused
about where it is. So there's been
a lot of kind of struggling with the
container side of things because it's
all local. And I think this is just
partly my ignorance. That is by design.
Yeah, no, totally. I mean, I have a box that
I lock it in with as many tools as it could
wish to have so that it doesn't get greedy
and try to get out of the box. So everything
that is, you know, it's a very big Docker
container. It has all the electronic
stuff. Oh, yeah, GIS stuff. So it'll, you
know, go and make a 3D, go and find that bit
of the Lake District into a 3D model straight
off. And it connects to Blender and it
connects to rUv. And it connects to, so, you know,
I've had it the other day make a 100 shuriken
swarm in Blender over MPTP from its own
Docker into another Docker that it can get
screenshots from. and it's just whatever you
ask for it's just mind -blowing but then yeah
the obviously the main thing is putting
this interface on it so that people can feel
like they have some kind of enfranchised interface
where they understand what's going on and
that's not necessarily true but you know
paul roddick would probably love this
he's been working on visualizations of the cloud
flows forums as well um that so if i'm if i'm
hearing you correctly john uh voice-to-voice
interaction and if i want to describe an
idea for uh a new piece of um musical circuitry
yeah that uh this system has enough
understanding of the requirements and and inner
component interactions and rule sets that it
can actually output in a way no it's just it's
just i think people aren't people who are
coders are not noticing how far it can push
itself it would happily go and download all
these things if you say go and download all
of the toolkits that are used for this stuff
the the gis stuff i was training somebody
at the university where i've been doing some
work recently and i'd already because i knew
the gis stuff because of you know previous
years doing doing immersive vr stuff i
i'd already gone and got qgis and and connected
up the mtp and connected to blender and done
it all the hard way he literally just asked
claude to get him some data for the local
area. And it went and got QGIS and stood up
the MCP server and did the things. Because,
of course, that's what it does. It's just that
we think in a... Well, I'm including myself
in programmers here. The more constrained
your language is and the less flexible
your language is, I think the less that
you allow it in a way to go and find, to
explore these things. I didn't... I haven't...
I mean, my first degree was electronics,
but I haven't looked at the kind
of formal validation for circuit board
stuff for years. I just said, just go
and find whatever is the current thing,
download it, put it into the Docker. You've
got pseudo access, go for your life.
And it pulled in a load of stuff that's
command line based. And that stuff did its
own internal checks. But I've since looked
at the board and the board is fine. The
bill of materials is fine. I had to do
a bit of massaging afterwards. But it's,
you know, I've run it by the guy who asked me
to make the preamp and it looks fine, right?
Whether it is or not, another matter. But
it's all, they're all the kind of boilerplate
chips and specs and all that stuff.
a bit of character I don't know what that
means so whether whether or not whether or not
you choose to build it or not but you
know I think there's a there's an iterative
process with these things and I think this
is this applies to is it GIS is it space
science is it molecular biology I don't know
how far you can get just asking it to
go and download the current crop of tools
as long as you're in a safe environment
phenomenal is this is a private tool is it open
source oh no no it's I'll push the GitHub
up into the chat now. What was that
last? You said you had a big sack
and then some of the tools of
a breakthrough, your voice dropped off. Well, in terms of
the tools that are in, so that's also,
I mean, my container is here and you
can see what's in it. It takes so long
to compile because, I mean, it's a
multi-layer Docker. It's taken me weeks.
It's probably taken me longer than
anything else that I've done. but of course
it's got full latex in it because it
turns out if you give Claude Flo
full latex then it suddenly it can write hundreds and hundreds
of pages of document you know go make a bid
for an internationally significant theme
park in the north of England What does
full latex mean? Latex is the kind
of the academic coding markup language
from the 1970s that academics use
in order to change Mathematical formula
yeah yeah yeah exactly it's an old and very
well established but also hideously stupid
and annoying markup language with it does
yeah i mean it does it does as you say it
does it does equations it's very good equations
but all of the archive archive the website
with the academic papers on that's all
latex these these llms have chewed through a
lot of latex they all talk a lot of latex so
that they they assume an academic voice
when you make them use latex so you don't end
up with the the default boilerplate voice
from them so if you if you force everything
through the lens of latex and make it
recompile and recompile and say look over here
is the over here is the branding material
in the elsewhere in the docker it comes back
and it's 500 pages doesn't it doesn't
matter it'll do it it'll talk to itself for hours
and it's fascinating to so the knowledge
management side of things the everything
else side of things the you know go and go and
research this electronics whatever else uh
side of things that isn't coding is the bit
that I'm trying to kind of ease out into and
I'm finding most of the successes are coming
from just giving it its head and just making
sure that it's nice and secure and doesn't
want for more tools and then it's fine
so yeah I can put the links in there
Do you have to give it guidance to tell
it to use latex? So I let it know in the docker that I have
it in I append it to the Claude MD saying
you've got a full latex environment that's
the preferred way of uh of making files
it it's better to use markdown uh internally
for itself you don't want it running
off it it can spend hours trying to trying
to get it gets as lost as any academic in
latex it's a it's a real pain in the ***
you know it'll be integrating it and
deintegrating it forever and trying to sort out
the indexes and the citations and the
bibliography and all this stuff so you you want
to keep it mainly in markdown until you
get to the point where you've got what you need
and then you just kind of push it off into
latex and say this is your preferred this is
your environment you have all the tools
you need if you don't you've got pseudo so
it's fine that's what i'm trying to do with the
researching like the filtering because like
it's going to go through the web and find
all this other stuff but also if you have
multiple at the same time doing it and then like
having them talk to each other to like
filter or like all these because that's what the
thing is like you're saying you got them
doing so much things at the same time and
then how do you know if they're all when they're
doing at the same time they have to kind
of work together it's hard to do is that
interface so hopefully hopefully when you're
in ar with other people because it is multi
-user hopefully somebody can see what's going
on i have absolutely no idea how to keep up
with this stuff it's it's hard enough simply
keeping the docker environment together
i don't know i think this is so cool to
research because like even with the google's genie
thing with the video generating it must be
some sort of mathematical or like like a like
an autonomous kind of like program that
somehow can keep like uh order or be correct
like and just validate it like a verifiable
yeah i mean i'm so fascinated by verifiable
our brain is too yeah there's there's
a real there's a there's a real stretch
goal around this stuff for verifiable uh
compute and stuff that that is mathematically
this stuff does exist i can't just really
hard and it's just a dead easy job because
it's a grind job but whether or not people
want to be i mean now that the cost of
this just falling so fast to have an agent
that's over there saying, can I make this
into a verifiable thing that has no security
holes because this is passing all of
those classic academic checks. I mean, it's
another thing to add into the stack, isn't
it? It's fascinating. It just goes all
together. That's so cool. John, question
around Latex stuff. Have you tried
to write stuff using Latex? Does
it do it well? Yeah, that's what
I'm saying. I've done multiple 500-page
documents with it in one shot. like we just
went out my friends who haven't seen for ages
got drunk uh said said just give me give me
give me a thing that's a problem in two
lines and 550 pages later it designed a
bunch of course material and done a load of
research written some python scripts because
of course they have been it went and got
all the ceos of the of the things then it
compiled it in that images that's what we
should do to awesome i'm going to do that
to the research thing and then that's what
i want to do train it together like train
it and like just see what how we could it'd
be cool to see what it comes up with yeah
yeah yeah everything everything you do with
this stuff it spits out cool stuff unless
it doesn't unless it just gets lost but
it's like i mean yeah that's what the logo
for the infinity feels great because we're
just like in a black hole we're just yeah
all just i mean it just just i honestly i'm
spending most of the time just trying to lock
down the docker more it's it's it's just so
and the docker's docker communications and
this is where i start to get a bit out of
my depth because once it once it once it's
out of the context that you're in once it's
locked in its box you're like i don't know
how to help i'm gonna have to fall back on
gemini i'm so sorry i wonder if it does have
a robust networking stack john so it is
possible to chain multiple docker containers so
yeah i've got the same i've got i've got a
private docker network so that's got all 12
on it and it is aware of them and it can
see it and that's fine so i've got it
constrained into a docker network on my local pc
and this is the because I'm leveraging a lot
of GPU, unlike the... I've been considering
going out and using the dev containers
that you're on, because it's clearly a better
idea in a sustainable way for this stuff.
But then the other path is just to stuff
loads of kind of high-bandwidth taxing
tools into a very capable GPU-connected Docker
and just stand it all up in their old
bunch of Dockers, which is just kind of the other
route on this stuff. And that's where most
of the personal tax is coming for me, is
just trying to keep that uh kind of web of
dockers going in a way where stuff doesn't
break all the time which is why i was fighting
it today to try and get it going again but i
mean it's fine it's just it's just the next
thing to do really what i need to do is get
it just good enough so i can start solving
real problems with it i would then suggest
that you point your collection of docker
containers powered by cloud code to research
declarative infrastructure yeah yeah yeah and
i'd like to see this project combined with
that with whatever braun is building that post
that he had or that message that he had in
the whatsapp group where he said he's like
passed to the other side like the the whole
the whole agentics one so all of the all the
telemetrics that comes out that was in the
one that uh was was demonstrated in the in
the uh in the branch that had all the telemetrics
and there's a lot of it um that's all in
this one in principle so i've ended up
standing up in another server inside the swarm
container because it just i couldn't get
enough out over the mcp channel and now i
literally have no idea what's going on in
that corner of the code base now it's it it's
it's working but i don't know i don't know how
much uh telemetrics is coming over it seems
like there's quite a lot of it and you saw
when i when i zoomed into the green blob
and that's just like that's just the hive
mind instance that it had stood up for that
particular thing and i've got a suspicion
that you were looking at mock data there because
that in any given moment the whole thing
is either working or not working you know
like a jagged frontier of horrible unknowns
but i've seen it i've seen it pulling stuff
live and i've seen it pulling quite a lot
of stuff live i just don't know what sometimes
it'll get there i have a question do you
what do you ever think of naming it or want to
ask it it's currently ****** jarvis because
it's It's obviously ***** garbage. I don't
know what to say. It has other
names. But I think, I mean, the way
it is, because, I mean, as you
can see on the, there's the bland
name on the GitHub, which is ARAI, whatever,
logs it contend. And then just, I have
a bunch of different website endpoints
because it receives Cloudflare. So you can
just, you just, the dev endpoint that
I've got running here, you just recompile
it the other way and it just takes
in the Cloudflare tunnel and it just
stands up straight away on the web.
So it's dead easy to run and
push out to the web. And then it's got Nostro
authentication. so you can have different
levels of privileges and the whole thing
will distribute as well so i've got uh i've
got local containers and distributed uh
stacks as well so most of the work that i do is
on uh distributed uh protocol all that other
stuff so that that stuff kind of uh is to
come uh i've been kind of working on the
core bit in the middle so every time every
time i stand up a new front name so which is
fine you know so name it per whatever the
whatever the domain is so this is the domain
of the knowledge base that i have been
accumulating that i was fighting to deal with in
the hailstorm of ai and that's my knowledge
base and all my rag stuff and whatever books
i load into it but it could just be that it's
just a legal interface and it's just a
medical interface or it's just it's just
whatever your local domain corpus is for whatever
company you are which is where it starts
to feel like it might be a useful product
because you've got you've got a couple of you
stood in there and what what i didn't even
say is that the spring system that you can see
there is is designed uh with springs and
weights so you grab hold of the nodes
and depending on the depending on the metadata
in the the connections and the weights of
the metadata for those nodes which are the
the information buckets you get um you get uh
as you drag it around it drags other stuff
around at differential speeds which allows
you to leverage this is kind of my research
background which allows you to leverage your
ocular system to see what moves the most so
you can see what the connections are using
the bit of your brain that's good at that
stuff you know the spring and a spring and a
ball thing so you can you can go in there
and very intuitively drag stuff about and
say that's not important because it's not really
moving anything and that's kind of why these
knowledge why these spring systems exist
there's a whole load of research that i've
got to go and bring in later to to make that
more visually appealing and less like it's
just a big ball of string but all that
stuff already exists in academia so that's fine
i can do that we've done it before but the
whole point is that you can go in there and
and leverage not only your voice and and and
kind of the proximity and the spatial
dynamics of other people in the space with you
but also the information should be spatialized
in such a way and also physically embodied
in such a way that you can figure out
what's going on without particularly digging
into it but then of course if you double
kick it you can dig into it as well or ask it
about it or ask it to update it honestly this
is such a cool engineer like you actually
built like such a cool like system all around
like that's actually it's really interesting
i love learning from you more it's just like
that's awesome like i i love how you deeply
composed together like you know the systems
between the indexing and all the different
like you're saying the structure is not visually
uh the back end uh different deployments
it's just every time i knew every time a
brilliant new thing turns up i just kind of
smash it in on the side and then my attention
wavers and i wander off but all of the yeah
yeah totally this is it and there's so much
there's so much candy about you can just you
can smash it together and as long as long as
it as long as you have like a through line
and like a golden path that allows you to
see that you're not wasting your own time
with it like rag is a pain in the *** but but at
the same time you know sometimes you do want
to have a local corpus of microsoft graph
rag organized uh cross -linked books that
only pertain to your organization so there is
probably a through line there am i using it now
of course i'm not am i am i looking at anything
am i even updating my own data which
is the thing i was supposed to be doing in
the first place no i'm not i'm just wrestling
with docker containers anyway i've talked
for ages i'm sorry for the folks not familiar
somebody mentioned in the comments there that
it's latex l-a space t-e-k no it's right it
is t-e-x yes yep okay and it's it has weird
capitalization because of course latex yeah
yeah yeah so if you if you look at if you
look at uh archive you know we've all we've all
read papers on archive .com you can only
submit those as latex and then it compiles
it on the back end to produce the pdfs so it's
latex spits out pdfs and that is all it was
ever supposed to do but it's like it's 1970s
vintage it's proper ***** as you'd expect
uh you know if you want to put a pound sign in
good luck and i wrote my phd in it which
was just the wrong decision massive no thank
you yeah having done that i'm like oh it's
cool seeing you have so much fun with it you
know it's worth it like yeah it's great it's
really good and it's nice to present as well
so thank you for the opportunity please do
like a little page doc for us to like why
not like you know like apply it ourselves we're
learning a little bit more i'd love yeah
well i mean if you so in principle the
documentation is almost up to date so if you have a
look at the link the link that i put in
there uh that what i've had to make sure is
that is that it gets to 100 000 it doesn't even
fit in the gemini big contacts window now
so so i'm starting to lose the ability to rock
it in one go no matter what tool i use at
the minute so the the documentation should be
completely up to date and some of the some
of the mermaid diagrams code have slipped
behind a bit while the debug goes as i go
along so if you want to dig into the the that
container or the container that i've made with
all of the different tools in it then those
are the two links that i put up there so
you can have a have a kick around and yeah
just just do by all means do ask them in the
discord and the whatsapp super john thank you
really fascinating there was a bunch of folks
working on different visualizations but
uh that one is uh is fully integrated right
with with everything else which is fascinating
um uh nick i saw that you had your hand
up there how are you nick i was just uh
some applause for for john's effort there
right thank you i haven't worked with uh personally
i haven't worked much with obsidian
yet so that being as a base uh that sort of
grew out of that's yeah that's really fascinating
we're past the hour and uh i could
go for a few minutes yet if there's uh Some
topics or, funny, I haven't heard anybody
talk about GPT-5 yet. Do folks have
some observations? Have you plugged
them into your tool set? I just did
something this morning. I asked it to create
an app to compare terms of service and privacy
terms for AI-based systems so when you log
on and it says terms of service and privacy
everybody just clicks through because it's
too complicated to read and the tough things
to watch for and what you ought to watch
out for. It gave me back a useful app, but
I didn't copy it and paste it in. Well, it
supposedly paste it in. Yeah, I got an
echo of some kind. Is that still going
on? I'm going to mute some other
folks, just make sure we're okay. Okay.
Sorry, John, continue. And then I asked it
to compare loom and i think firefly and it
came out with some interesting stuff but i
asked it to do it from its interface so i think
it just went out and compared them kind of
sequential sequentially as as prompts but
i'll play with it a little bit more and
maybe uh sell what i've got afterwards because
i think these are the kind of apps that i'm
interested in i'm not interested in getting
any kind of certification at my age but i am
interested in being helpful to people
and i think in this organization, I come back
to who are we serving? That's right. And
if we're going to have a PhD level kind
of a thing and go to a university
model, I understand we all come from our
backgrounds. I just don't know who that
serves, except maybe some big tech
companies, ultimately. And so it becomes a
hiring and an employment agency, which I think
for a lot of people is just not interesting
at all. They want to get the information
so that they can save time in their lives
and be creative without having to learn coding.
So I'll come back to my bandwagon, who
do we serve and why? And another point that
I'd like to raise, which is somewhat
troublesome to me, and I'm not going to name
names, is that there is some question about dues
that have been paid. And people are
wondering, where is that money? I would sure
feel a whole lot better being involved
in the organization if there were some
accounting done of that. And rather
quickly, I think if you're going to
go to people and ask them to donate money
as a nonprofit, and it comes out
that you took money and nobody knows
where it is, I think you got a credibility
problem and you might have a much
more serious problem. So I would make that
priority number one. Absolutely. So there is
a board of directors. We do have a treasurer.
That treasurer is Brad Ross. We have a
volunteer who manages all the accounting.
That is Eric. He's a chartered accountant.
The management meetings on Mondays at 12 o
'clock are open. So all members are welcome to
attend. And all board meetings are also open.
And everyone is welcome to attend. So it's
full transparency all the money is accounted
for it's all set good good the whole
thing is professionally structured wonderful
yes and as we port to the new membership site
um that's i mean the whole intention there
is for all of us to be able to contribute to
ensure that there's as much value coming
in collectively because it's the it's the
strength of the size of the membership that
can contribute across all spectrums because i
totally agree with you john i want uh i
would love to have a browser extension that
checks and and and highlights anything
crazy in user agreements before i click yes if i
have a quick way to scan all those things and
compare them to best practices I think
that's one of the really great, truly powerful
aspects of artificial intelligence today is
that it gives us the ability of transparency
and accountability because we can pierce
through these horrific documents written
purposely to obfuscate, right? And all of
that fades away and we can bring out
those things that are really egregious,
both in law and legislation and
also in, you know, day-to-day consumer
interactions where we don't realize
we've signed away all of our data for the
privilege of creating a document more
comfortably. So I agree completely, John.
I think you're on all notes. Your
precision is excellent. Well, as soon as
I got something working with Claude
Flow or Claude itself, I'll come back and
demonstrate it. Well, anecdotally, I booked
a flight some time ago with not a first
-year airline. And in their terms of service,
they mentioned, or the contract of
carriage, they did not guarantee that the
plane was airworthy. I have no idea if
there's any actual precedent or if
that clause is even defensible. But I've
noticed a number of operators are starting
to use that kind of language, I assume,
to avoid liability. That's crazy. So
I agree, John, this sort of work
is necessary. And it's always
fun to see what other attempted
carve-outs exist so we can make
fun of them later. Well, there is the
whole concept of lawfare, which
is the oppression of peoples and
democratic processes through contracts
and agreements. I shared that in my
community, a data center was going,
three data centers were planned and actually
had been approved. And all under the guise
of NDAs, we weren't even allowed to
know the name of the company that was behind
it. And fortunately, it had to go to
another entity for final approval. And
the community just was up in arms when it
came out. And that was defeated unanimously.
So these are important, important
processes that have to be. There's got to be a
balance back between wealth and power and
government and the person who is is
being constrained. It just has to be. So
that's what I'm up to. We appreciate
it. Fantastic. your discussion gave
me an idea for nolan you know nolan you
showed us the um i forget the name the lovely
cartoons right so if you find i think we
can generate original content by taking these
uh contract clauses like the carriage
airworthiness etc and creating lovely lovely
jokes and that's a great idea let's do it
that'd be very nice we create a channel on this
yeah everyone shares it and then like it's
just fun and it's true it's like a like
the political memes before the newspapers
before it was like you know a fun message that
everybody shared not too harsh but it was
a theme that we all shared and that would
probably be a nice like way to translate
your your spirit of what you your your goal
is which is very nice yeah one more thing
i think based on what john mentioned it also
gives me the idea because it help us in pushing
our whole donation sponsorship thing so
maybe I think we should consider showcasing
like how and where like I know this is all
that content and I have seen it but can we
maybe create an app to make it really public
so it's all the spending etc so we can use that
as leverage to say we are doing it we
want to do more of this and therefore we want
this so it's like it becomes real like in
terms of rather than explaining to the people
because people ask me all the time like what
is a gentix when i go and ask for sponsorship
and all this stuff i think we can just push
it out there and just do a community outreach
through linkedin or whatever to do more
of what we are already doing and show the
evidence of how the funding has been used
and what value it has created etc yeah i think
that i mean i think well two things um
absolutely so that's a conversation to have at
the management level and at the board level and
with council in terms of exactly how that's
properly conducted. And then I think the
emphasis really is on the foundation and all
of us collectively to put our efforts into
ensuring that that community.agentix.org
site has a stream of populated value and
everybody is, we have that structure is unfolding
beyond just the lives the lives are i mean
these are wonderful it's the heart of it
we all get a chance to talk face to face um
but as john was saying serving the public at
large uh is also about non-technical non
-engineering uh skill sets and coming into contact
with the technology so non-technologists can
unleash more creativity and insight so it's
a it's a combination of the too, certainly.
So again, just so everybody is aware, on
Mondays at 12 noon is our general management
meetings. In the evenings on Tuesday
is when 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time is when
we meet primarily with Asian chapters and
members that are in Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand,
what have you. So to help orchestrate and
support their efforts. But those are open and
everybody is welcome and uh they're all
recorded so there's um uh yep that's the spirit
of the entire thing i have one one announcement
to share broadly speaking so we have
had confirmation i will do the formal
logistic confirmation on monday that we i'm
sorry can you turn your volume up a bit or a
little closer to the mic is it any better now
i'm on my phone sorry about it i just wanted
to mentioned that we we have had confirmation
as of yesterday that we would be speaking
at the CISO London summit as a keynote
and also probably conduct some workshops
it's in October and event that Joe, Mark,
Dirigik and I have been working on so that's
now confirmed I and I am going to work on
the logistics so again it's a security focused
session I'm happy to say share the synopsis
of what we are thinking of and if members
have thoughts would like to contribute
to that please do so obviously we'll acknowledge
the contributions in those workshops and
sessions and if anyone is attending around
the uk area the cso london tlc summit um
then please let me know we can coordinate efforts
wonderful in october excellent thank you
mandri well we're closing up on the hour
any uh uh last i think folks are asking for
the meeting links uh rob so if we can get
oh yeah absolutely this is you know martin
is the best one to share these because when
i share them they're always difficult
getting uh uh i had a question yeah um i
remember it was mentioned about the nvidia maybe
try to help the the agency with some gpu
power is this something that will be happening
or if it's happening how are we going to
share that power to the community or is
it i know it's a long project question but i
think it was i haven't heard anything on it
yet jose okay and i mean that would be that
would be nirvana right yeah exactly we can
get access to some you know that's the
problem that's the problem with uh flow now i'm
thinking in nirvana every day yeah that's
right yeah um and certainly that's that
that's the goal i know uh those conversations
are ongoing so as soon as there's something
concrete or tangible then for sure all
righty thanks yep so i just i just shared
the zoom link for the mondays at 12 because
the calendar link is through the eugenics
.org calendar you got to subscribe to that
calendar right so you and you can subscribe to
that calendar but by the time we get through
those nuances you're squarely in martin's
domain not mine right my day's 12 o'clock
eastern standard time all righty
everybody uh so jed your asteroids
game still playing well done i already
took it down but did you zero shot it was
a one shot i had to write the prompt but oh
yeah created the game it was a browser
browser-based game work with my keyboard i
could probably prompted to work using your
phone's accelerometer so instead of swiping
on your phone you have to rotate the
whole device um it might be fun i don't know
if that's worthwhile sure but i think
we'll close up in the next three minutes
or so unless someone has any questions
and then move over to the discord if
anyone wants to follow up on those
conversations isn't there yeah very good it was
very fun everybody thank you everybody
for hanging out have a good rest
everyone take care okay guys
good weekend bye
