*Context: secondary systems. So a lot of, and what I'm not showing you guys, is like all the MCPs. So when I'm in here running these tools, and let's jump into the plot for a moment, you know, there's a combina...*

## I took all that stuff, we put it

I took all that stuff, we put it together to create this and we packaged it as an MPX or you can install and run using TypeScript. So really, really fast, really light and really powerful. So what I'm going to

*Context: all built in Rust and compiled to a WASM. And then we've got the neural network components and the neural forecasting components. I took all that stuff, we put it together to create this and we packag...*

Yeah, so just as an FYI, you don't have to use the Claude-flow CLI or the CLI. All you need to do to use Claude-flow is type Cloud and then use the dangerously skipped permission option here. And then what you

like is the Mastra approach to their MCPs. So for Mastra, which is basically another sort you can actually call any MCP as part of the flow itself, right? So this is how you call a secondary MCP directly.
