# Claude Flow Tips & Best Practices

Based on analysis of community transcripts, here are the key actionable tips for using Claude Flow effectively:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Use the Dangerously Skip Permissions Flag
When running Claude Flow locally, you can bypass permission checks:
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```
**Note:** Only use this flag in development environments, never in production.

## ü§ñ Swarm Orchestration

### Understanding Swarm vs Hive Mind Approaches
- **Swarm Approach**: Multiple independent agents working on separate tasks
- **Hive Mind Approach**: Agents sharing knowledge and coordinating closely
- Choose based on whether your tasks need tight coordination or can run independently

### Prevent Agent Conflicts
When running multiple agents (5-6 task agents), you need a coordination system to prevent conflicts:
- Use orchestrators to clearly define what each agent should do
- Agents should have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities
- The orchestrator maintains clarity on task distribution

### Running Multiple Terminal Orchestrators
You can run different agent types in separate terminals:
- Use Claude Opus for the main orchestrator
- Use Claude Sonnet for worker agents
- Each terminal can have a specific type of orchestrator/worker

## üì¶ MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

### Understanding MCP Tools
- MCP tools provide access to ~87 different system tools
- MCP servers communicate with hosts to provide tool lists
- The host queries servers for available capabilities during boot

### Using MCP with Swarms
- MCP tools can be integrated with swarm orchestration
- Tools are exposed through the MCP protocol
- Each agent can access different MCP tools based on needs

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflows

### Creating Custom Workflows with Agents
1. Define your requirements and optimization goals
2. Put these into either agents or commands folders
3. Have these folders relate to one another
4. Use standard Claude with your custom instantiation
5. Claude Flow will leverage your custom setup

### Building with TypeScript
Claude Flow can be:
- Installed and run using TypeScript
- Built with Rust and compiled to WASM
- Integrated with neural network components
- Very fast, light, and powerful

## üí° Performance Optimization

### Batch Tool Operations
Instead of using swarms for everything, consider batch tools:
- Batch tools execute multiple operations without agent overhead
- Claude Code can do 5 things at once with batch tools
- More efficient for simple parallel tasks that don't need coordination

### Agent Activity Patterns
- Agents are only active for very short amounts of time
- This makes tracking specific agent activity challenging
- Cloud Code executes agents as another framework layer

## üîß Advanced Features

### Neural Components
Claude Flow includes:
- Neural network components for forecasting
- Pattern recognition capabilities
- Memory injection and analysis features

### Using Grandfathered Clusters
For cost optimization:
- Some users have grandfathered clusters at $0.03
- Current floor is around $1.50
- Still cost-effective but not as cheap as legacy pricing

### Web Dashboard Integration
For building dashboards:
- Use Claude Flow's web services endpoints
- API documentation available for integration
- WebSocket support for real-time swarm visualization

## üìä Monitoring & Visualization

### Swarm Visualization
- Dashboard shows active/inactive agents
- Icons indicate which swarms are running
- Can spawn different swarms and have them work together
- Real-time monitoring of agent coordination

### Tracking Performance
When using SWE-bench for testing:
- Swarm approaches can achieve 100% completion
- Test with varying numbers of agents (5, 50, etc.)
- Monitor completion rates and performance metrics

## üéØ Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic swarm configurations before adding complexity
2. **Clear Task Definition**: Ensure each agent has well-defined responsibilities
3. **Use Appropriate Tools**: Choose between swarm, batch tools, or direct Claude based on task
4. **Monitor Activity**: Use dashboards to track agent performance
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Use benchmarks like SWE-bench to validate your setup
6. **Coordinate Properly**: Implement coordination systems for multi-agent workflows
7. **Optimize Costs**: Be aware of pricing tiers and optimize usage accordingly
